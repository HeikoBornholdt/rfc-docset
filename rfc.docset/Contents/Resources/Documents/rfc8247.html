Abstract

   The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic
   algorithms in order to provide security services.  The Internet Key
   Exchange (IKE) protocol is used to negotiate the IPsec Security
   Association (IPsec SA) parameters, such as which algorithms should be
   used.  To ensure interoperability between different implementations,
   it is necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation
   requirements and usage guidance to ensure that there is at least one
   algorithm that all implementations support.  This document updates
   <a href="./rfc7296.html">RFC 7296</a> and obsoletes <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> in defining the current algorithm
   implementation requirements and usage guidance for IKEv2, and does
   minor cleaning up of the IKEv2 IANA registry.  This document does not
   update the algorithms used for packet encryption using IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).

   The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol [<a href="./rfc7296.html" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7296</a>] is used to
   negotiate the parameters of the IPsec SA, such as the encryption and
   authentication algorithms and the keys for the protected
   communications between the two endpoints.  The IKE protocol itself is

   also protected by cryptographic algorithms, which are negotiated
   between the two endpoints using IKE.  Different implementations of
   IKE may negotiate different algorithms based on their individual
   local policy.  To ensure interoperability, a set of "mandatory-to-
   implement" IKE cryptographic algorithms is defined.

   This document describes the parameters of the IKE protocol and
   updates the IKEv2 specification.  It changes the mandatory-to-
   implement authentication algorithms in <a href="./rfc7296.html#section-4">SectionÂ 4 of [RFC7296]</a> by
   saying that RSA key lengths of less than 2048 <em>SHOULD NOT</em> be used.  It
   does not describe the cryptographic parameters of the Authentication
   Header (AH) or ESP protocols.

   The key words "<em>MUST</em>", "<em>MUST NOT</em>", "<em>REQUIRED</em>", "<em>SHALL</em>", "<em>SHALL NOT</em>",
   "<em>SHOULD</em>", "<em>SHOULD NOT</em>", "<em>RECOMMENDED</em>", "NOT <em>RECOMMENDED</em>", "<em>MAY</em>", and
   "<em>OPTIONAL</em>" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/bcp/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [<a href="./rfc2119.html" title='"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>RFC2119</a>] [<a href="./rfc8174.html" title='"Ambiguity of Uppercase vs Lowercase in RFC 2119 Key Words"'>RFC8174</a>] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   When used in the tables in this document, these terms indicate that
   the listed algorithm <em>MUST</em>, <em>MUST NOT</em>, <em>SHOULD</em>, <em>SHOULD NOT</em>, or <em>MAY</em> be
   implemented as part of an IKEv2 implementation.  Additional terms
   used in this document are:

   <em>SHOULD</em>+   This term means the same as <em>SHOULD</em>.  However, it is likely
             that an algorithm marked as <em>SHOULD</em>+ will be promoted at
             some future time to be a <em>MUST</em>.

   <em>SHOULD</em>-   This term means the same as <em>SHOULD</em>.  However, an algorithm
             marked as <em>SHOULD</em>- may be deprecated to a <em>MAY</em> in a future
             version of this document.

   <em>MUST</em>-     This term means the same as <em>MUST</em>.  However, it is expected
             at some point that this algorithm will no longer be a <em>MUST</em>
             in a future document.  Although its status will be
             determined at a later time, it is reasonable to expect that
             if a future revision of a document alters the status of a
             <em>MUST</em>- algorithm, it will remain at least a <em>SHOULD</em> or a
             <em>SHOULD</em>- level.

   IoT       This abbreviation stands for "Internet of Things".

Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance</span>

   The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New, stronger
   algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less secure
   than originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm implementation
   requirements and usage guidance need to be updated from time to time
   to reflect the new reality.  The choices for algorithms must be
   conservative to minimize the risk of algorithm compromise.
   Algorithms need to be suitable for a wide variety of CPU
   architectures and device deployments ranging from high-end bulk
   encryption devices to small low-power IoT devices.

   The algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance may need
   to change over time to adapt to the changing world.  For this reason,
   the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms was removed from
   the main IKEv2 specification and placed in this separate document.

<span class="h3"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/1.3.%20%20Updating%20Algorithm%20Requirement%20Levels"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-1.3" id="section-1.3">1.3</a>.  Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels</span>

   The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should already be
   available in most implementations of IKE by the time it is made
   mandatory.  This document attempts to identify and introduce those
   algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement status.  There is no
   guarantee that the algorithms in use today may become mandatory in
   the future.  Published algorithms are continuously subjected to
   cryptographic attack and may become too weak or could become
   completely broken before this document is updated.

   This document provides updated recommendations for the mandatory-to-
   implement algorithms.  As a result, any algorithm listed at the IKEv2
   IANA registry not mentioned in this document <em>MAY</em> be implemented.  For
   clarification and consistency with [<a href="./rfc4307.html" title='"Cryptographic Algorithms for Use in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC4307</a>], an algorithm will be
   denoted here as <em>MAY</em> only when it has been downgraded.

   Although this document updates the algorithms to keep the IKEv2
   communication secure over time, it also aims at providing
   recommendations so that IKEv2 implementations remain interoperable.
   IKEv2 interoperability is addressed by an incremental introduction or
   deprecation of algorithms.  In addition, this document also considers
   the new use cases for IKEv2 deployment, such as Internet of Things
   (IoT).

   It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm is performed
   gradually.  This provides time for various implementations to update
   their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless
   there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
   downgraded from <em>MUST</em> to <em>MUST</em>- or <em>SHOULD</em>, instead of <em>MUST NOT</em>.

   Similarly, an algorithm that has not been mentioned as mandatory-to-
   implement is expected to be introduced with a <em>SHOULD</em> instead of a
   <em>MUST</em>.

   The current trend toward Internet of Things and its adoption of IKEv2
   requires this specific use case to be taken into account as well.
   IoT devices are resource-constrained devices and their choice of
   algorithms are motivated by minimizing the footprint of the code, the
   computation effort, and the size of the messages to send.  This
   document indicates "(IoT)" when a specified algorithm is specifically
   listed for IoT devices.  Requirement levels that are marked as "IoT"
   apply to IoT devices and to server-side implementations that might
   presumably need to interoperate with them, including any general-
   purpose VPN gateways.

   The recommendations of this document mostly target IKEv2 implementers
   who need to create implementations that meet both high security
   expectations as well as high interoperability between various vendors
   and with different versions.  Interoperability requires a smooth move
   to more secure cipher suites.  This may differ from a user point of
   view that may deploy and configure IKEv2 with only the safest cipher
   suite.

   This document does not give any recommendations for the use of
   algorithms, it only gives implementation recommendations regarding
   implementations.  The use of algorithms by a specific user is
   dictated by their own security policy requirements, which are outside
   the scope of this document.

   IKEv1 is out of scope of this document.  IKEv1 is deprecated and the
   recommendations of this document must not be considered for IKEv1, as
   most IKEv1 implementations have been "frozen" and will not be able to
   update the list of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.

   (*)    This requirement level is for 128-bit and 256-bit keys.
          192-bit keys remain at the <em>MAY</em> level.

   (IoT)  This requirement is for interoperability with IoT.  Only
          128-bit keys are at the <em>SHOULD</em> level. 192-bit and 256-bit
          remain at the <em>MAY</em> level.

   ENCR_AES_CBC is raised from <em>SHOULD</em>+ for 128-bit keys and <em>MAY</em> for
   256-bit keys in [<a href="./rfc4307.html" title='"Cryptographic Algorithms for Use in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC4307</a>] to <em>MUST</em>. 192-bit keys remain at the <em>MAY</em>
   level.  ENCR_AES_CBC is the only shared mandatory-to-implement
   algorithm with <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> and as a result, it is necessary for
   interoperability with IKEv2 implementation compatible with <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>.

   ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 was not ready to be considered at the time of
   <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>'s publication.  It has been recommended by the Crypto Forum
   Research Group (CFRG) of the IRTF as an alternative to AES-CBC and
   AES-GCM.  It is also being standardized for IPsec for the same
   reasons.  At the time of writing, there were not enough IKEv2
   implementations supporting ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 to be able to
   introduce it at the <em>SHOULD</em>+ level.

   ENCR_AES_GCM_16 was not considered in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>.  At the time <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>
   was written, AES-GCM was not defined in an IETF document.  AES-GCM
   was defined for ESP in [<a href="./rfc4106.html" title='"The Use of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) in IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)"'>RFC4106</a>] and later for IKEv2 in [<a href="./rfc5282.html" title='"Using Authenticated Encryption Algorithms with the Encrypted Payload of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC5282</a>].
   The main motivation for adopting AES-GCM for ESP is encryption
   performance compared to AES-CBC.  This resulted in AES-GCM being
   widely implemented for ESP.  As the computation load of IKEv2 is
   relatively small compared to ESP, many IKEv2 implementations have not
   implemented AES-GCM.  For this reason, AES-GCM is not promoted to a
   greater status than <em>SHOULD</em>.  The reason for promotion from <em>MAY</em> to
   <em>SHOULD</em> is to promote the slightly more secure AEAD method over the
   traditional encrypt+auth method.  Its status is expected to be raised
   once widely implemented.  As the advantage of the shorter (and
   weaker) Integrity Check Values (ICVs) is minimal, the 8- and 12-octet
   ICVs remain at the <em>MAY</em> level.

   ENCR_AES_CCM_8 was not considered in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>.  This document
   considers it as <em>SHOULD</em> be implemented in order to be able to interact
   with IoT devices.  As this case is not a general use case for non-IoT
   VPNs, its status is expected to remain as <em>SHOULD</em>.  The 8-octet size
   of the ICV is expected to be sufficient for most use cases of IKEv2,
   as far less packets are exchanged in those cases, and IoT devices
   want to make packets as small as possible.  The <em>SHOULD</em> level is for
   128-bit keys, 256-bit keys remains at <em>MAY</em> level.

   ENCR_3DES has been downgraded from <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> <em>MUST</em>- to <em>MAY</em>.  All IKEv2
   implementations already implement ENCR_AES_CBC, so there is no need
   to keep support for the much slower ENCR_3DES.  In addition,
   ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 provides a more modern alternative to AES.

   ENCR_DES can be brute-forced using off-the-shelf hardware.  It
   provides no meaningful security whatsoever and, therefore, <em>MUST NOT</em>
   be implemented.

   ENCR_NULL was incorrectly specified as <em>MAY</em> in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>, even when
   <a href="./rfc7296.html#section-5">[RFC7296], SectionÂ 5</a> clearly states that it <em>MUST NOT</em> be used.  This
   was fixed and this document now lists ENCR_NULL as <em>MUST NOT</em>.

   PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512 <em>SHOULD</em> be implemented as a future replacement for
   PRF_HMAC_SHA2_256 or when stronger security is required.
   PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512 is preferred over PRF_HMAC_SHA2_384 as the
   additional overhead of PRF_HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.

   PRF_HMAC_SHA1 has been downgraded from <em>MUST</em> in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>MUST</em>-, as
   cryptographic attacks against SHA1 are increasing, resulting in an
   industry-wide trend to deprecate its usage.

   PRF_AES128_XCBC is only recommended in the scope of IoT, as Internet
   of Things deployments tend to prefer AES-based pseudorandom functions
   in order to avoid implementing SHA2.  For the non-IoT VPN deployment,
   it has been downgraded from <em>SHOULD</em> in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>MAY</em> as it has not
   seen wide adoption.

   PRF_HMAC_MD5 has been downgraded from <em>MAY</em> in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>MUST NOT</em>.
   Cryptographic attacks against MD5, such as collision attacks
   mentioned in [<a href="#ref-TRANSCRIPTION">TRANSCRIPTION</a>], are resulting in an industry-wide trend
   to deprecate and remove MD5 (and thus HMAC-MD5) from cryptographic
   libraries.

   AUTH_DES_MAC and AUTH_KPDK_MD5 were not mentioned in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a>, so
   their default statuses were <em>MAY</em>.  These have been downgraded to <em>MUST</em>
   NOT.  AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96 is also demoted to <em>MUST NOT</em>.  This is because
   there is an industry-wide trend to deprecate DES and MD5.  Note also
   that MD5 support is being removed from cryptographic libraries in
   general because its non-HMAC use is known to be subject to collision
   attacks, for example, as mentioned in [<a href="#ref-TRANSCRIPTION">TRANSCRIPTION</a>].

   There are several Modular Exponential (MODP) groups and several
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups that are defined for use in
   IKEv2.  These groups are defined in both the base document [<a href="./rfc7296.html" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7296</a>]
   and in extension documents and are identified by group number.  Note
   that it is critical to enforce a secure Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange
   as this exchange provides keys for the session.  If an attacker can
   retrieve one of the private numbers (a or b) and the complementary
   public value (g**b or g**a), then the attacker can compute the secret
   and the keys used and then decrypt the exchange and IPsec SA created
   inside the IKEv2 SA.  Such an attack can be performed off-line on a
   previously recorded communication, years after the communication
   happened.  This differs from attacks that need to be executed during
   the authentication that must be performed online and in near real
   time.

   Group 14 or the 2048-bit MODP Group is raised from <em>SHOULD</em>+ in
   <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>MUST</em> as a replacement for the 1024-bit MODP Group.  Group
   14 is widely implemented and considered secure.

   Group 19 or the 256-bit random ECP group was not specified in
   <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> as this group was not defined at that time.  Group 19 is
   widely implemented and considered secure and, therefore, has been
   promoted to the <em>SHOULD</em> level.

   Group 5 or the 1536-bit MODP Group has been downgraded from <em>MAY</em> in
   <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>SHOULD NOT</em>.  It was specified earlier, but is now
   considered to be vulnerable to being broken within the next few years
   by a nation-state-level attack, so its security margin is considered
   too narrow.

   Group 2 or the 1024-bit MODP Group has been downgraded from <em>MUST</em>- in
   <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> to <em>SHOULD NOT</em>.  It is known to be weak against sufficiently
   funded attackers using commercially available mass-computing
   resources, so its security margin is considered too narrow.  It is
   expected in the near future to be downgraded to <em>MUST NOT</em>.

   Group 1 or the 768-bit MODP Group was not mentioned in <a href="./rfc4307.html">RFC 4307</a> and
   so its status was <em>MAY</em>.  It can be broken within hours using cheap
   off-the-shelf hardware.  It provides no security whatsoever.  It has,
   therefore, been downgraded to <em>MUST NOT</em>.

   Groups 22, 23, and 24 are MODP groups with Prime Order Subgroups that
   are not safe primes.  The seeds for these groups have not been
   publicly released, resulting in reduced trust in these groups.  These

   IKEv2 authentication may involve a signatures verification.
   Signatures may be used to validate a certificate or to check the
   signature of the AUTH value.  Cryptographic recommendations regarding
   certificate validation are out of scope of this document.  What is
   mandatory to implement is provided by the PKIX community.  This
   document is mostly concerned with signature verification and

   RSA Digital Signature is widely deployed and, therefore, kept for
   interoperability.  It is expected to be downgraded in the future as
   its signatures are based on the older RSASSA-PKCS1-v1.5, which is no
   longer recommended.  RSA authentication, as well as other specific
   authentication methods, are expected to be replaced with the generic
   Digital Signature method of [<a href="./rfc7427.html" title='"Signature Authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7427</a>].

   Shared Key Message Integrity Code is widely deployed and mandatory to
   implement in the IKEv2 in <a href="./rfc7296.html">RFC 7296</a>.  The status remains <em>MUST</em>.

   "DSS Digital Signature" (IANA value 3) signatures are bound to SHA-1
   and have the same level of security as 1024-bit RSA.  They are
   currently at <em>SHOULD NOT</em> and are expected to be downgraded to <em>MUST NOT</em>
   in the future.

   Authentication methods that are based on the Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) are also expected to be downgraded as
   these do not provide hash function agility.  Instead, ECDSA (like
   RSA) is expected to be performed using the generic Digital Signature
   method.  Its status is <em>SHOULD</em>.

   Digital Signature [<a href="./rfc7427.html" title='"Signature Authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7427</a>] is expected to be promoted as it provides
   hash function, signature format, and algorithm agility.  Its current
   status is <em>SHOULD</em>.

   IKEv2 [<a href="./rfc7296.html" title='"Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)"'>RFC7296</a>] mandates support for the RSA keys of the bit size
   1024 or 2048, but key sizes less than 2048 are updated to <em>SHOULD NOT</em>
   as there is an industry-wide trend to deprecate key lengths less than
   2048 bits.  Since these signatures only have value in real time and
   need no future protection, smaller keys were kept at <em>SHOULD NOT</em>
   instead of <em>MUST NOT</em>.

   Some algorithms in this document are marked for use with the Internet
   of Things (IoT).  There are several reasons why IoT devices prefer a
   different set of algorithms from regular IKEv2 clients.  IoT devices
   are usually very constrained, meaning that the memory size and CPU
   power is so limited that these clients only have resources to
   implement and run one set of algorithms.  For example, instead of
   implementing AES and SHA, these devices typically use AES_XCBC as an
   integrity algorithm so SHA does not need to be implemented.

   For example, IEEE Std 802.15.4 [<a href="#ref-IEEE-802-15-4">IEEE-802-15-4</a>] devices have a
   mandatory-to-implement link-level security using AES-CCM with 128-bit
   keys.  The "IEEE Recommended Practice for Transport of Key Management
   Protocol (KMP) Datagrams" [<a href="#ref-IEEE-802-15-9">IEEE-802-15-9</a>] already provides a way to
   use Minimal IKEv2 [<a href="./rfc7815.html" title='"Minimal Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Initiator Implementation"'>RFC7815</a>] over the 802.15.4 layer to provide link
   keys for the 802.15.4 layer.

   These devices might want to use AES-CCM as their IKEv2 algorithm, so
   they can reuse the hardware implementing it.  They cannot use the
   AES-CBC algorithm, as the hardware quite often does not include
   support for the AES decryption needed to support the CBC mode.  So
   despite the AES-CCM algorithm requiring AEAD [<a href="./rfc5282.html" title='"Using Authenticated Encryption Algorithms with the Encrypted Payload of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) Protocol"'>RFC5282</a>] support, the
   benefit of reusing the crypto hardware makes AES-CCM the preferred
   algorithm.

   Another important aspect of IoT devices is that their transfer rates
   are usually quite low (in the order of tens of kbit/s), and each bit
   they transmit has an energy consumption cost associated with it and



<span class="grey">Nir, et al.                  Standards Track                   [Page 14]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc8247.html">RFC 8247</a>             IKEv2 Cryptographic Algorithms       September 2017</span>


   shortens their battery life.  Therefore, shorter packets are
   preferred.  This is the reason for recommending the 8-octet ICV over
   the 16-octet ICV.

   Because different IoT devices will have different constraints, this
   document cannot specify the one mandatory profile for IoT.  Instead,
   this document points out commonly used algorithms with IoT devices.

<span class="h2"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/5.%20%20Security%20Considerations"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-5" id="section-5">5</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The security of cryptographic-based systems depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering of the protocol used by the system to ensure that
   there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the
   overall system.

   The Diffie-Hellman Group parameter is the most important one to
   choose conservatively.  Any party capturing all IKE and ESP traffic
   that (even years later) can break the selected DH group in IKE, can
   gain access to the symmetric keys used to encrypt all the ESP
   traffic.  Therefore, these groups must be chosen very conservatively.
   However, specifying an extremely large DH group also puts a
   considerable load on the device, especially when this is a large VPN
   gateway or an IoT-constrained device.

   This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of IKEv2, specifically with the selection of
   "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as "<em>MUST</em> implement" or "<em>SHOULD</em> implement" are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research so far
   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this isn't necessarily forever and it
   is expected that new revisions of this document will be issued from
   time to time to reflect the current best practice in this area.

   This document renames some of the names in the "Transform Type 1 -

   ENCR_ prefix except 3, and all other entries use names in the format
   of uppercase words separated with underscores except 6.  This
   document changes those names to match others.
