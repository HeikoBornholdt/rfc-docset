Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management
    of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

Abstract

   This document defines the procedures that the Internet Assigned
   Numbers Authority (IANA) uses when handling assignment and other
   requests related to the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
   Number registry.  It also discusses the rationale and principles
   behind these procedures and how they facilitate the long-term
   sustainability of the registry.

   This document updates IANA's procedures by obsoleting the previous
   UDP and TCP port assignment procedures defined in Sections <a href="#section-8">8</a> and <a href="#section-9.1">9.1</a>
   of the IANA Allocation Guidelines, and it updates the IANA service
   name and port assignment procedures for UDP-Lite, the Datagram
   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and the Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  It also updates the DNS SRV
   specification to clarify what a service name is and how it is
   registered.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   For many years, the assignment of new service names and port number
   values for use with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [<a href="./rfc0793.html" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">RFC0793</a>]
   and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [<a href="./rfc0768.html" title="&quot;User Datagram Protocol&quot;">RFC0768</a>] has had less than
   clear guidelines.  New transport protocols have been added -- the
   Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [<a href="./rfc4960.html" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>] and the
   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [<a href="./rfc4342.html" title="&quot;Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)&quot;">RFC4342</a>] -- and new
   mechanisms like DNS SRV records [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>] have been developed, each
   with separate registries and separate guidelines.  The community also
   recognized the need for additional procedures beyond just assignment;
   notably modification, revocation, and release.

   A key element of the procedural streamlining specified in this
   document is to establish identical assignment procedures for all IETF
   transport protocols.  This document brings the IANA procedures for
   TCP and UDP in line with those for SCTP and DCCP, resulting in a
   single process that requesters and IANA follow for all requests for
   all transport protocols, including future protocols not yet defined.

   In addition to detailing the IANA procedures for the initial
   assignment of service names and port numbers, this document also
   specifies post-assignment procedures that until now have been handled
   in an ad hoc manner.  These include procedures to de-assign a port
   number that is no longer in use, to take a port number assigned for
   one service that is no longer in use and reuse it for another
   service, and the procedure by which IANA can unilaterally revoke a
   prior port number assignment.  <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> discusses the specifics of
   these procedures and processes that requesters and IANA follow for
   all requests for all current and future transport protocols.

   IANA is the authority for assigning service names and port numbers.
   The registries that are created to store these assignments are
   maintained by IANA.  For protocols developed by IETF working groups,
   IANA now also offers a method for the "early assignment" [<a href="./rfc4020.html" title="&quot;Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points&quot;">RFC4020</a>] of
   service names and port numbers, as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.

   This document updates IANA's procedures for UDP and TCP port numbers
   by obsoleting Sections <a href="#section-8">8</a> and <a href="#section-9.1">9.1</a> of the IANA Allocation Guidelines
   [<a href="./rfc2780.html" title="&quot;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers&quot;">RFC2780</a>].  (Note that other sections of the IANA Allocation
   Guidelines, relating to the protocol field values in IPv4 headers,
   were also updated in February 2008 [<a href="./rfc5237.html" title="&quot;IANA Allocation Guidelines for the Protocol Field&quot;">RFC5237</a>].)  This document also
   updates the IANA assignment procedures for DCCP [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>] [<a href="./rfc5595.html" title="&quot;The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes&quot;">RFC5595</a>]
   and SCTP [<a href="./rfc4960.html" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>].

   The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) shares the port
   space with UDP.  The UDP-Lite specification [<a href="./rfc3828.html" title="&quot;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)&quot;">RFC3828</a>] says: "UDP-Lite
   uses the same set of port number values assigned by the IANA for use
   by UDP".  An update of the UDP procedures therefore also results in a
   corresponding update of the UDP-Lite procedures.

   This document also clarifies what a service name is and how it is
   assigned.  This will impact the DNS SRV specification [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>],
   because that specification merely makes a brief mention that the
   symbolic names of services are defined in "Assigned Numbers"
   [<a href="./rfc1700.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>], without stating to which section it refers within that
   230-page document.  The DNS SRV specification may have been referring
   to the list of Port Assignments (known as /etc/services on Unix), or
   to the "Protocol And Service Names" section, or to both, or to some
   other section.  Furthermore, "Assigned Numbers" [<a href="./rfc1700.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>] has been
   obsoleted [<a href="./rfc3232.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers: RFC 1700 is Replaced by an On-line Database&quot;">RFC3232</a>] and has been replaced by on-line registries
   [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>] [<a href="#ref-PROTSERVREG" title="&quot;Protocol and Service Names Registry&quot;">PROTSERVREG</a>].

   The development of new transport protocols is a major effort that the
   IETF does not undertake very often.  If a new transport protocol is
   standardized in the future, it is expected to follow these guidelines
   and practices around using service names and port numbers as much as
   possible, for consistency.

   At the time of writing of this document, the internal procedures of
   "Expert Review" teams, including that of IANA's port review team, are
   not documented in any RFC and this document doesn't change that.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Motivation</span>

   Information about the assignment procedures for the port registry has
   existed in three locations: the forms for requesting port number
   assignments on the IANA web site [<a href="#ref-SYSFORM" title="&quot;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number&quot;">SYSFORM</a>] [<a href="#ref-USRFORM" title="&quot;Application for User (Registered) Port Number&quot;">USRFORM</a>], an introductory
   text section in the file listing the port number assignments
   themselves (known as the port numbers registry) [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>], and two
   brief sections of the IANA Allocation Guidelines [<a href="./rfc2780.html" title="&quot;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers&quot;">RFC2780</a>].

   Similarly, the procedures surrounding service names have been
   historically unclear.  Service names were originally created as
   mnemonic identifiers for port numbers without a well-defined syntax,
   apart from the 14-character limit mentioned on the IANA website
   [<a href="#ref-SYSFORM" title="&quot;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number&quot;">SYSFORM</a>] [<a href="#ref-USRFORM" title="&quot;Application for User (Registered) Port Number&quot;">USRFORM</a>].  Even that length limit has not been
   consistently applied, and some assigned service names are 15
   characters long.  When service identification via DNS SRV Resource
   Records (RRs) was introduced [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>], it became useful to start
   assigning service names alone, and because IANA had no procedure for
   assigning a service name without an associated port number, this led

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   to the creation of an informal temporary service name registry
   outside of the control of IANA, which now contains roughly 500
   service names [<a href="#ref-SRVREG" title="&quot;DNS SRV Service Types Registry&quot;">SRVREG</a>].

   This document aggregates all this scattered information into a single
   reference that aligns and clearly defines the management procedures
   for both service names and port numbers.  It gives more detailed
   guidance to prospective requesters of service names and ports than
   the existing documentation, and it streamlines the IANA procedures
   for the management of the registry, so that requests can be completed
   in a timely manner.

   This document defines rules for assignment of service names without
   associated port numbers, for such usages as DNS SRV records
   [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>], which was not possible under the previous IANA procedures.
   The document also merges service name assignments from the non-IANA
   ad hoc registry [<a href="#ref-SRVREG" title="&quot;DNS SRV Service Types Registry&quot;">SRVREG</a>] and from the IANA Protocol and Service Names
   registry [<a href="#ref-PROTSERVREG" title="&quot;Protocol and Service Names Registry&quot;">PROTSERVREG</a>] into the IANA Service Name and Transport
   Protocol Port Number registry [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>], which from here on is the
   single authoritative registry for service names and port numbers.

   An additional purpose of this document is to describe the principles
   that guide the IETF and IANA in their role as the long-term joint
   stewards of the service name and port number registry.  TCP and UDP
   have had remarkable success over the last decades.  Thousands of
   applications and application-level protocols have service names and
   port numbers assigned for their use, and there is every reason to
   believe that this trend will continue into the future.  It is hence
   extremely important that management of the registry follow principles
   that ensure its long-term usefulness as a shared resource.  <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a>
   discusses these principles in detail.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Background</span>

   The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [<a href="./rfc0793.html" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">RFC0793</a>] and the User
   Datagram Protocol (UDP) [<a href="./rfc0768.html" title="&quot;User Datagram Protocol&quot;">RFC0768</a>] have enjoyed a remarkable success
   over the decades as the two most widely used transport protocols on
   the Internet.  They have relied on the concept of "ports" as logical
   entities for Internet communication.  Ports serve two purposes:
   first, they provide a demultiplexing identifier to differentiate
   transport sessions between the same pair of endpoints, and second,
   they may also identify the application protocol and associated
   service to which processes connect.  Newer transport protocols, such
   as the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [<a href="./rfc4960.html" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>] and the
   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [<a href="./rfc4342.html" title="&quot;Profile for Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control ID 3: TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC)&quot;">RFC4342</a>], have also
   adopted the concept of ports for their communication sessions and use
   16-bit port numbers in the same way as TCP and UDP (and UDP-Lite
   [<a href="./rfc3828.html" title="&quot;The Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite)&quot;">RFC3828</a>], a variant of UDP).



<span class="grey">Cotton, et al.            Best Current Practice                 [Page 6]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   Port numbers are the original and most widely used means for
   application and service identification on the Internet.  Ports are
   16-bit numbers, and the combination of source and destination port
   numbers together with the IP addresses of the communicating end
   systems uniquely identifies a session of a given transport protocol.
   Port numbers are also known by their associated service names such as
   "telnet" for port number 23 and "http" (as well as "www" and
   "www-http") for port number 80.

   All involved parties -- hosts running services, hosts accessing
   services on other hosts, and intermediate devices (such as firewalls
   and NATs) that restrict services -- need to agree on which service
   corresponds to a particular destination port.  Although this is
   ultimately a local decision with meaning only between the endpoints
   of a connection, it is common for many services to have a default
   port upon which those servers usually listen, when possible, and
   these ports are recorded by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) through the service name and port number registry [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>].

   Over time, the assumption that a particular port number necessarily
   implies a particular service may become less true.  For example,
   multiple instances of the same service on the same host cannot
   generally listen on the same port, and multiple hosts behind the same
   NAT gateway cannot all have a mapping for the same port on the
   external side of the NAT gateway, whether using static port mappings
   configured by hand by the user, or dynamic port mappings configured
   automatically using a port mapping protocol like the NAT Port Mapping
   Protocol [<a href="#ref-NAT-PMP" title="&quot;NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT- PMP)&quot;">NAT-PMP</a>] or Internet Gateway Device [<a href="#ref-IGD" title="&quot;Internet Gateway Device (IGD) V 1.0&quot;">IGD</a>].

   Applications may use port numbers directly, look up port numbers
   based on service names via system calls such as getservbyname() on
   UNIX, look up port numbers by performing queries for DNS SRV records
   [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>] [<a href="#ref-DNS-SD" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">DNS-SD</a>], or determine port numbers in a variety of other
   ways like the TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX) [<a href="./rfc1078.html" title="&quot;TCP port service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)&quot;">RFC1078</a>].

   Designers of applications and application-level protocols may apply
   to IANA for an assigned service name and port number for a specific
   application, and may -- after assignment -- assume that no other
   application will use that service name or port number for its
   communication sessions.  Application designers also have the option
   of requesting only an assigned service name without a corresponding
   fixed port number if their application does not require one, such as
   applications that use DNS SRV records to look up port numbers
   dynamically at run-time.  Because the port number space is finite
   (and therefore conservation is an important goal), the alternative of
   using service names instead of port numbers is RECOMMENDED whenever
   possible.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [<a href="./rfc2119.html" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>].

   This document uses the term "assignment" to refer to the procedure by
   which IANA provides service names and/or port numbers to requesting
   parties; other RFCs refer to this as "allocation" or "registration".
   This document assumes that all these terms have the same meaning, and
   will use terms other than "assignment" only when quoting from or
   referring to text in these other documents.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Service Names</span>

   Service names are the unique key in the Service Name and Transport
   Protocol Port Number registry.  This unique symbolic name for a
   service may also be used for other purposes, such as in DNS SRV
   records [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>].  Within the registry, this unique key ensures that
   different services can be unambiguously distinguished, thus
   preventing name collisions and avoiding confusion about who is the
   Assignee for a particular entry.

   There may be more than one service name associated with a particular
   transport protocol and port.  There are three ways that such port
   number overloading can occur:

   o  Overloading occurs when one service is an extension of another
      service, and an in-band mechanism exists for determining if the
      extension is present or not.  One example is port 3478, which has
      the service name aliases "stun" and "turn".  Traversal Using
      Relays around NAT (TURN) [<a href="./rfc5766.html" title="&quot;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5766</a>] is an extension to the Session
      Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [<a href="./rfc5389.html" title="&quot;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5389</a>] service.  TURN-
      enabled clients wishing to locate TURN servers could attempt to
      discover "stun" services and then check in-band if the server also
      supports TURN, but this would be inefficient.  Enabling them to
      directly query for "turn" servers by name is a better approach.
      (Note that TURN servers in this case should also be locatable via
      a "stun" discovery, because every TURN server is also a STUN
      server.)

   o  By historical accident, the service name "http" has two synonyms
      "www" and "www-http".  When used in SRV records [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>] and
      similar service discovery mechanisms, only the service name "http"
      should be used, not these additional names.  If a server were to
      advertise "www", it would not be discovered by clients browsing
      for "http".  Advertising or browsing for the aliases as well as



<span class="grey">Cotton, et al.            Best Current Practice                 [Page 8]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


      the primary service name is inefficient, and achieves nothing that
      is not already achieved by using the service name "http"
      exclusively.

   o  As indicated in this document in <a href="#section-10.1">Section 10.1</a>, overloading has
      been used to create replacement names that are consistent with the
      syntax this document prescribes for legacy names that do not
      conform to this syntax already.  For such cases, only the new name
      should be used in SRV records, to avoid the same issues as with
      historical cases of multiple names, and also because the legacy
      names are incompatible with SRV record use.

   Assignment requests for new names for existing registered services
   will be rejected, as a result.  Implementers are requested to inform
   IANA if they discover other cases where a single service has multiple
   names, so that one name may be recorded as the primary name for
   service discovery purposes.

   Service names are assigned on a "first come, first served" basis, as
   described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>.  Names should be brief and informative,
   avoiding words or abbreviations that are redundant in the context of
   the registry (e.g., "port", "service", "protocol", etc.)  Names
   referring to discovery services, e.g., using multicast or broadcast
   to identify endpoints capable of a given service, SHOULD use an
   easily identifiable suffix (e.g., "-disc").

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.1" href="#section-5.1">5.1</a>.  Service Name Syntax</span>

   Valid service names are hereby normatively defined as follows:

   o  MUST be at least 1 character and no more than 15 characters long

   o  MUST contain only US-ASCII [<a href="#ref-ANSI.X3.4-1986" title="&quot;Coded Character Set - 7-bit American Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot;">ANSI.X3.4-1986</a>] letters 'A' - 'Z' and
      'a' - 'z', digits '0' - '9', and hyphens ('-', ASCII 0x2D or
      decimal 45)

   o  MUST contain at least one letter ('A' - 'Z' or 'a' - 'z')

   o  MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen

   o  hyphens MUST NOT be adjacent to other hyphens

   The reason for requiring at least one letter is to avoid service
   names like "23" (could be confused with a numeric port) or "6000-
   6063" (could be confused with a numeric port range).  Although
   service names may contain both upper-case and lower-case letters,
   case is ignored for comparison purposes, so both "http" and "HTTP"
   denote the same service.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   Service names are purely opaque identifiers, and no semantics are
   implied by any superficial structure that a given service name may
   appear to have.  For example, a company called "Example" may choose
   to register service names "Example-Foo" and "Example-Bar" for its
   "Foo" and "Bar" products, but the "Example" company cannot claim to
   "own" all service names beginning with "Example-"; they cannot
   prevent someone else from registering "Example-Baz" for a different
   service, and they cannot prevent other developers from using the
   "Example-Foo" and "Example-Bar" service types in order to
   interoperate with the "Foo" and "Bar" products.  Technically
   speaking, in service discovery protocols, service names are merely a
   series of byte values on the wire; for the mnemonic convenience of
   human developers, it can be convenient to interpret those byte values
   as human-readable ASCII characters, but software should treat them as
   purely opaque identifiers and not attempt to parse them for any
   additional embedded meaning.

   As of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
   Names" [<a href="#ref-SYSFORM" title="&quot;Application for System (Well Known) Port Number&quot;">SYSFORM</a>] [<a href="#ref-USRFORM" title="&quot;Application for User (Registered) Port Number&quot;">USRFORM</a>] for existing port number assignments
   [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>] already met the rules for legal service names stated in
   <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>, and hence for these services their service name is
   exactly the same as their historical "Short Name".  In approximately
   2% of cases, the new "service name" is derived based on the old
   "Short Name" as described below in <a href="#section-10.1">Section 10.1</a>.

   The rules for valid service names, excepting the limit of 15
   characters maximum, are also expressed below (as a non-normative
   convenience) using ABNF [<a href="./rfc5234.html" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>].

      SRVNAME = *(1*DIGIT [HYPHEN]) ALPHA *([HYPHEN] ALNUM)
      ALNUM   = ALPHA / DIGIT     ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9
      HYPHEN  = %x2D              ; "-"
      ALPHA   = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z [<a href="./rfc5234.html" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>]
      DIGIT   = %x30-39           ; 0-9       [<a href="./rfc5234.html" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">RFC5234</a>]

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-5.2" href="#section-5.2">5.2</a>.  Service Name Usage in DNS SRV Records</span>

   The DNS SRV specification [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>] states that the Service Label
   part of the owner name of a DNS SRV record includes a "Service"
   element, described as "the symbolic name of the desired service", but
   as discussed above, it is not clear precisely what this means.

   This document clarifies that the Service Label MUST be a service name
   as defined herein with an underscore prepended.  The service name
   SHOULD be registered with IANA and recorded in the Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number registry [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>].

   The details of using Service Names in SRV Service Labels are
   specified in the DNS SRV specification [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Port Number Ranges</span>

   TCP, UDP, UDP-Lite, SCTP, and DCCP use 16-bit namespaces for their
   port number registries.  The port registries for all of these
   transport protocols are subdivided into three ranges of numbers
   [<a href="./rfc1340.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1340</a>], and <a href="#section-8.1.2">Section 8.1.2</a> describes the IANA procedures for each
   range in detail:

   o  the System Ports, also known as the Well Known Ports, from 0-1023
      (assigned by IANA)

   o  the User Ports, also known as the Registered Ports, from 1024-
      49151 (assigned by IANA)

   o  the Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private or Ephemeral Ports,
      from 49152-65535 (never assigned)

   Of the assignable port ranges (System Ports and User Ports, i.e.,
   port numbers 0-49151), individual port numbers are in one of three
   states at any given time:

   o  Assigned: Assigned port numbers are currently assigned to the
      service indicated in the registry.

   o  Unassigned: Unassigned port numbers are currently available for
      assignment upon request, as per the procedures outlined in this
      document.

   o  Reserved: Reserved port numbers are not available for regular
      assignment; they are "assigned to IANA" for special purposes.
      Reserved port numbers include values at the edges of each range,
      e.g., 0, 1023, 1024, etc., which may be used to extend these
      ranges or the overall port number space in the future.

   In order to keep the size of the registry manageable, IANA typically
   only records the Assigned and Reserved service names and port numbers
   in the registry.  Unassigned values are typically not explicitly
   listed.  (There are very many Unassigned service names and
   enumerating them all would not be practical.)

   As a data point, when this document was written, approximately 76% of
   the TCP and UDP System Ports were assigned, and approximately 9% of
   the User Ports were assigned.  (As noted, Dynamic Ports are never
   assigned.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Service Names and Port Numbers for Experimentation</span>

   Of the System Ports, two TCP and UDP port numbers (1021 and 1022),
   together with their respective service names ("exp1" and "exp2"),
   have been assigned for experimentation with new applications and
   application-layer protocols that require a port number in the
   assigned ports range [<a href="./rfc4727.html" title="&quot;Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers&quot;">RFC4727</a>].

   Please refer to Sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-1.1">1.1</a> of "Assigning Experimental and
   Testing Numbers Considered Useful" [<a href="./rfc3692.html" title="&quot;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful&quot;">RFC3692</a>] for how these
   experimental port numbers are to be used.

   This document assigns the same two service names and port numbers for
   experimentation with new application-layer protocols over SCTP and
   DCCP in <a href="#section-10.2">Section 10.2</a>.

   Unfortunately, it can be difficult to limit access to these ports.
   Users SHOULD take measures to ensure that experimental ports are
   connecting to the intended process.  For example, users of these
   experimental ports might include a 64-bit nonce, once on each segment
   of a message-oriented channel (e.g., UDP), or once at the beginning
   of a byte-stream (e.g., TCP), which is used to confirm that the port
   is being used as intended.  Such confirmation of intended use is
   especially important when these ports are associated with privileged
   (e.g., system or administrator) processes.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Principles for Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number</span>
<span class="h2">    Registry Management</span>

   Management procedures for the Service Name and Transport Protocol
   Port Number registry include assignment of service names and port
   numbers upon request, as well as management of information about
   existing assignments.  The latter includes maintaining contact and
   description information about assignments, revoking abandoned
   assignments, and redefining assignments when needed.  Of these
   procedures, careful port number assignment is most critical, in order
   to continue to conserve the remaining port numbers.

   As noted earlier, only about 9% of the User Port space is currently
   assigned.  The current rate of assignment is approximately 400 ports
   per year, and has remained steady for the past 8 years.  At that
   rate, if similar conservation continues, this resource will sustain
   another 85 years of assignment - without the need to resort to
   reassignment of released values or revocation.  The namespace
   available for service names is much larger, which allows for simpler
   management procedures.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Past Principles</span>

   The principles for service name and port number management are based
   on the recommendations of the IANA "Expert Review" team.  Until
   recently, that team followed a set of informal guidelines developed
   based on the review experience from previous assignment requests.
   These original guidelines, although informal, had never been publicly
   documented.  They are recorded here for historical purposes only; the
   current guidelines are described in <a href="#section-7.2">Section 7.2</a>.  These guidelines
   previously were:

   o  TCP and UDP ports were simultaneously assigned when either was
      requested

   o  Port numbers were the primary assignment; service names were
      informative only, and did not have a well-defined syntax

   o  Port numbers were conserved informally, and sometimes
      inconsistently (e.g., some services were assigned ranges of many
      port numbers even where not strictly necessary)

   o  SCTP and DCCP service name and port number registries were managed
      separately from the TCP/UDP registries

   o  Service names could not be assigned in the old ports registry
      without assigning an associated port number at the same time

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  Updated Principles</span>

   This section summarizes the current principles by which IANA both
   handles the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number registry
   and attempts to conserve the port number space.  This description is
   intended to inform applicants requesting service names and port
   numbers.  IANA has flexibility beyond these principles when handling
   assignment requests; other factors may come into play, and exceptions
   may be made to best serve the needs of the Internet.  Applicants
   should be aware that IANA decisions are not required to be bound to
   these principles.  These principles and general advice to users on
   port use are expected to change over time.

   IANA strives to assign service names that do not request an
   associated port number assignment under a simple "First Come First
   Served" policy [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>].  IANA MAY, at its discretion, refer service
   name requests to "Expert Review" in cases of mass assignment requests
   or other situations where IANA believes "Expert Review" is advisable
   [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>]; use of the "Expert Review" helps advise IANA informally in
   cases where "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" is used, as with most
   IETF protocols.

<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-1-14" id="page-1-14" href="#page-1-14" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   The basic principle of service name and port number registry
   management is to conserve use of the port space where possible.
   Extensions to support larger port number spaces would require
   changing many core protocols of the current Internet in a way that
   would not be backward compatible and interfere with both current and
   legacy applications.

   Conservation of the port number space is required because this space
   is a limited resource, so applications are expected to participate in
   the traffic demultiplexing process where feasible.  The port numbers
   are expected to encode as little information as possible that will
   still enable an application to perform further demultiplexing by
   itself.  In particular, the principles form a goal that IANA strives
   to achieve for new applications (with exceptions as deemed
   appropriate, especially as for extensions to legacy services) as
   follows:

   o  IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number per service
      or application.

      Note: At the time of writing of this document, there is no IETF
      consensus on when it is appropriate to use a second port for an
      insecure version of a protocol.

   o  IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number for all
      variants of a service (e.g., for updated versions of a service).

   o  IANA strives to encourage the deployment of secure protocols.

   o  IANA strives to assign only one assigned port number for all
      different types of devices using or participating in the same
      service.

   o  IANA strives to assign port numbers only for the transport
      protocol(s) explicitly named in an assignment request.

   o  IANA may recover unused port numbers, via the new procedures of
      de-assignment, revocation, and transfer.

   Where possible, a given service is expected to demultiplex messages
   if necessary.  For example, applications and protocols are expected
   to include in-band version information, so that future versions of
   the application or protocol can share the same assigned port.
   Applications and protocols are also expected to be able to
   efficiently use a single assigned port for multiple sessions, either
   by demultiplexing multiple streams within one port or by using the
   assigned port to coordinate using dynamic ports for subsequent
   exchanges (e.g., in the spirit of FTP [<a href="./rfc0959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC0959</a>]).



<span class="grey">Cotton, et al.            Best Current Practice                [Page 14]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-1-15" id="page-1-15" href="#page-1-15" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   Ports are used in various ways, notably:

   o  as endpoint process identifiers

   o  as application protocol identifiers

   o  for firewall-filtering purposes

   Both the process-identifier and the protocol-identifier uses suggest
   that anything a single process can demultiplex, or that can be
   encoded into a single protocol, should be.  The firewall-filtering
   use suggests that some uses that could be multiplexed or encoded
   could instead be separated to allow for easier firewall management.
   Note that this latter use is much less sound, because port numbers
   have meaning only for the two endpoints involved in a connection, and
   drawing conclusions about the service that generated a given flow
   based on observed port numbers is not always reliable.

   Effective with the publication of this document, IANA will begin
   assigning port numbers for only those transport protocols explicitly
   included in an assignment request.  This ends the long-standing
   practice of automatically assigning a port number to an application
   for both TCP and UDP, even if the request is for only one of these
   transport protocols.  The new assignment procedure conserves
   resources by assigning a port number to an application for only those
   transport protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP, and/or DCCP) it actually uses.
   The port number will be marked as Reserved -- instead of Assigned --
   in the port number registries of the other transport protocols.  When
   applications start supporting the use of some of those additional
   transport protocols, the Assignee for the assignment MUST request
   that IANA convert these reserved ports into assignments.  An
   application MUST NOT assume that it can use a port number assigned to
   it for use with one transport protocol with another transport
   protocol without IANA converting the reservation into an assignment.

   When the available pool of unassigned numbers has run out in a port
   range, it will be necessary for IANA to consider the Reserved ports
   for assignment.  This is part of the motivation for not automatically
   assigning ports for transport protocols other than the requested
   one(s).  This will allow more ports to be available for assignment at
   that point.  To help conserve ports, application developers SHOULD
   request assignment of only those transport protocols that their
   application currently uses.

   Conservation of port numbers is improved by procedures that allow
   previously assigned port numbers to become Unassigned, either through
   de-assignment or through revocation, and by a procedure that lets
   application designers transfer an assigned but unused port number to

   a new application.  <a href="#section-8">Section 8</a> describes these procedures, which until
   now were undocumented.  Port number conservation is also improved by
   recommending that applications that do not require an assigned port
   should register only a service name without an associated port
   number.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  IANA Procedures for Managing the Service Name and Transport Protocol</span>
<span class="h2">    Port Number Registry</span>

   This section describes the process for handling requests associated
   with IANA's management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol
   Port Number registry.  Such requests include initial assignment, de-
   assignment, reuse, and updates to the contact information or
   description associated with an assignment.  Revocation is an
   additional process, initiated by IANA.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1" href="#section-8.1">8.1</a>.  Service Name and Port Number Assignment</span>

   Assignment refers to the process of providing service names or port
   numbers to applicants.  All such assignments are made from service
   names or port numbers that are Unassigned or Reserved at the time of
   the assignment.

   o  Unassigned names and numbers are assigned according to the rules
      described in <a href="#section-8.1.2">Section 8.1.2</a> below.

   o  Reserved numbers and names are generally only assigned by a
      "Standards Action" or "IESG Approval", and MUST be accompanied by
      a statement explaining the reason a Reserved number or name is
      appropriate for this action.  The only exception to this rule is
      that the current Assignee of a port number MAY request the
      assignment of the corresponding Reserved port number for other
      transport protocols when needed.  IANA will initiate an "Expert
      Review" [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>] for such requests.

   When an assignment for one or more transport protocols is approved,
   the port number for any non-requested transport protocol(s) will be
   marked as Reserved.  IANA SHOULD NOT assign that port number to any
   other application or service until no other port numbers remain
   Unassigned in the requested range.  It is anticipated that at such
   time a new document will be published specifying IANA procedures for
   assignment of such ports.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1.1" href="#section-8.1.1">8.1.1</a>.  General Assignment Procedure</span>

   A service name or port number assignment request contains the
   following information.  The service name is the unique identifier of
   a given service:

      Service Name (REQUIRED)
      Transport Protocol(s) (REQUIRED)
      Assignee (REQUIRED)
      Contact (REQUIRED)
      Description (REQUIRED)
      Reference (REQUIRED)
      Port Number (OPTIONAL)
      Service Code (REQUIRED for DCCP only)
      Known Unauthorized Uses (OPTIONAL)
      Assignment Notes (OPTIONAL)

   o  Service Name: A desired unique service name for the service
      associated with the assignment request MUST be provided.  This
      name may be used with various service selection and discovery
      mechanisms (including, but not limited to, DNS SRV records
      [<a href="./rfc2782.html" title="&quot;A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV)&quot;">RFC2782</a>]).  The name MUST be compliant with the syntax defined in
      <a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>.  In order to be unique, they MUST NOT be identical to
      any currently assigned service name in the IANA registry
      [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>].  Service names are case-insensitive; they may be
      provided and entered into the registry with mixed case for
      clarity, but case is ignored otherwise.

   o  Transport Protocol(s): The transport protocol(s) for which an
      assignment is requested MUST be provided.  This field is currently
      limited to one or more of TCP, UDP, SCTP, and DCCP.  Requests
      without any port assignment and only a service name are still
      required to indicate which protocol the service uses.

   o  Assignee: Name and email address of the party to whom the
      assignment is made.  This is REQUIRED.  The Assignee is the
      organization, company or individual person responsible for the
      initial assignment.  For assignments done through RFCs published
      via the "IETF Document Stream" [<a href="./rfc4844.html" title="&quot;The RFC Series and RFC Editor&quot;">RFC4844</a>], the Assignee will be the
      IESG &lt;iesg@ietf.org&gt;.

   o  Contact: Name and email address of the Contact person for the
      assignment.  This is REQUIRED.  The Contact person is the
      responsible person for the Internet community to send questions
      to.  This person is also authorized to submit changes on behalf of
      the Assignee; in cases of conflict between the Assignee and the
      Contact, the Assignee decisions take precedence.  Additional

      address information MAY be provided.  For assignments done through
      RFCs published via the "IETF Document Stream" [<a href="./rfc4844.html" title="&quot;The RFC Series and RFC Editor&quot;">RFC4844</a>], the
      Contact will be the IETF Chair &lt;chair@ietf.org&gt;.

   o  Description: A short description of the service associated with
      the assignment request is REQUIRED.  It should avoid all but the
      most well-known acronyms.

   o  Reference: A description of (or a reference to a document
      describing) the protocol or application using this port.  This is
      REQUIRED.  The description must state whether the protocol uses
      IP-layer broadcast, multicast, or anycast communication.

      For assignments requesting only a Service Name, or a Service Name
      and User Port, a statement that the protocol is proprietary and
      not publicly documented is also acceptable, provided that the
      required information regarding the use of IP broadcast, multicast,
      or anycast is given.

      For any assignment request that includes a User Port, the
      assignment request MUST explain why a port number in the Dynamic
      Ports range (discovered by clients dynamically at run-time) is
      unsuitable for the given application.

      For any assignment request that includes a System Port, the
      assignment request MUST explain why a port number in the User
      Ports or Dynamic Ports ranges is unsuitable, and a reference to a
      stable protocol specification document MUST be provided.

      IANA MAY accept early assignment [<a href="./rfc4020.html" title="&quot;Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points&quot;">RFC4020</a>] requests (known as
      "early allocation" therein) from IETF working groups that
      reference a sufficiently stable Internet-Draft instead of a
      published Standards-Track RFC.

   o  Port Number: If assignment of a port number is desired, either the
      port number the requester suggests for assignment or indication of
      port range (user or system) MUST be provided.  If only a service
      name is to be assigned, this field is left empty.  If a specific
      port number is requested, IANA is encouraged to assign the
      requested number.  If a range is specified, IANA will choose a
      suitable number from the User or System Ports ranges.  Note that
      the applicant MUST NOT use the requested port in implementations
      deployed for use on the public Internet prior to the completion of
      the assignment, because there is no guarantee that IANA will
      assign the requested port.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   o  Service Code: If the assignment request includes DCCP as a
      transport protocol, then the request MUST include a desired unique
      DCCP service code [<a href="./rfc5595.html" title="&quot;The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes&quot;">RFC5595</a>], and MUST NOT include a requested DCCP
      service code otherwise.  <a href="#section-19.8">Section 19.8</a> of the DCCP specification
      [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>] defines requirements and rules for assignment, updated
      by this document.  Note that, as per the DCCP Service Codes
      document [<a href="./rfc5595.html" title="&quot;The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Service Codes&quot;">RFC5595</a>], some service codes are not assigned; zero
      (absence of a meaningful service code) and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF;
      invalid service code) are permanently reserved, and the Private
      service codes 1056964608-1073741823 (0x3F000000-0x3FFFFFFF; i.e.,
      32-bit values with the high-order byte equal to a value of 63
      (0x3F), corresponding to the ASCII character '?') are not
      centrally assigned.

   o  Known Unauthorized Uses: A list of uses by applications or
      organizations who are not the Assignee.  This is OPTIONAL.  This
      list may be augmented by IANA after assignment when unauthorized
      uses are reported.

   o  Assignment Notes: Indications of owner/name change, or any other
      assignment process issue.  This is OPTIONAL.  This list may be
      updated by IANA after assignment to help track changes to an
      assignment, e.g., de-assignment, owner/name changes, etc.

   If the assignment request is for the addition of a new transport
   protocol to a previously assigned service name and the requester is
   not the Assignee or Contact for the previously assigned service name,
   IANA needs to confirm with the Assignee for the existing assignment
   whether this addition is appropriate.

   If the assignment request is for a new service name sharing the same
   port as a previously assigned service name (see port number
   overloading in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>), IANA needs to confirm with the Assignee
   for the existing service name and other appropriate experts whether
   the overloading is appropriate.

   When IANA receives an assignment request -- containing the above
   information -- that is requesting a port number, IANA SHALL initiate
   an "Expert Review" [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>] in order to determine whether an
   assignment should be made.  For requests that are not seeking a port
   number, IANA SHOULD assign the service name under a simple "First
   Come First Served" policy [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.1.2" href="#section-8.1.2">8.1.2</a>.  Variances for Specific Port Number Ranges</span>

   <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> describes the different port number ranges.  It is
   important to note that IANA applies slightly different procedures
   when managing the different port ranges of the service name and port
   number registry:

   o  Ports in the Dynamic Ports range (49152-65535) have been
      specifically set aside for local and dynamic use and cannot be
      assigned through IANA.  Application software may simply use any
      dynamic port that is available on the local host, without any sort
      of assignment.  On the other hand, application software MUST NOT
      assume that a specific port number in the Dynamic Ports range will
      always be available for communication at all times, and a port
      number in that range hence MUST NOT be used as a service
      identifier.

   o  Ports in the User Ports range (1024-49151) are available for
      assignment through IANA, and MAY be used as service identifiers
      upon successful assignment.  Because assigning a port number for a
      specific application consumes a fraction of the shared resource
      that is the port number registry, IANA will require the requester
      to document the intended use of the port number.  For most IETF
      protocols, ports in the User Ports range will be assigned under
      the "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>] and no
      further documentation is required.  Where these procedures do not
      apply, then the requester must input the documentation to the
      "Expert Review" procedure [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>], by which IANA will have a
      technical expert review the request to determine whether to grant
      the assignment.  Regardless of the path ("IETF Review", "IESG
      Approval", or "Expert Review"), the submitted documentation is
      expected to be the same, as described in this section, and MUST
      explain why using a port number in the Dynamic Ports range is
      unsuitable for the given application.  Further, IANA MAY utilize
      the "Expert Review" process informally to inform their position in
      participating in "IETF Review" and "IESG Approval".

   o  Ports in the System Ports range (0-1023) are also available for
      assignment through IANA.  Because the System Ports range is both
      the smallest and the most densely assigned, the requirements for
      new assignments are more strict than those for the User Ports
      range, and will only be granted under the "IETF Review" or "IESG
      Approval" procedures [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>].  A request for a System Port
      number MUST document *both* why using a port number from the
      Dynamic Ports range is unsuitable *and* why using a port number
      from the User Ports range is unsuitable for that application.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.2" href="#section-8.2">8.2</a>.  Service Name and Port Number De-Assignment</span>

   The Assignee of a granted port number assignment can return the port
   number to IANA at any time if they no longer have a need for it.  The
   port number will be de-assigned and will be marked as Reserved.  IANA
   should not reassign port numbers that have been de-assigned until all
   unassigned port numbers in the specific range have been assigned.

   Before proceeding with a port number de-assignment, IANA needs to
   reasonably establish that the value is actually no longer in use.

   Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
   space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that a
   given service name remain assigned even after all associated port
   number assignments have become de-assigned.  Under this policy, it
   will appear in the registry as if it had been created through a
   service name assignment request that did not include any port
   numbers.

   On rare occasions, it may still be useful to de-assign a service
   name.  In such cases, IANA will mark the service name as Reserved.
   IANA will involve their IESG-appointed expert in such cases.

   IANA will include a comment in the registry when de-assignment
   happens to indicate its historic usage.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.3" href="#section-8.3">8.3</a>.  Service Name and Port Number Reuse</span>

   If the Assignee of a granted port number assignment no longer has a
   need for the assigned number, but would like to reuse it for a
   different application, they can submit a request to IANA to do so.

   Logically, port number reuse is to be thought of as a de-assignment
   (<a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>) followed by an immediate (re-)assignment (<a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>)
   of the same port number for a new application.  Consequently, the
   information that needs to be provided about the proposed new use of
   the port number is identical to what would need to be provided for a
   new port number assignment for the specific ports range.

   Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
   space compared to the port number space, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   original service name associated with the prior use of the port
   number remains assigned, and a new service name be created and
   associated with the port number.  This is again consistent with
   viewing a reuse request as a de-assignment followed by an immediate
   (re-)assignment.  Reusing an assigned service name for a different
   application is NOT RECOMMENDED.

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>         Service Name and Port Number Procedures     August 2011</span>


   IANA needs to carefully review such requests before approving them.
   In some instances, the Expert Reviewer will determine that the
   application the port number was assigned to has found usage beyond
   the original Assignee, or that there is a concern that it may have
   such users.  This determination MUST be made quickly.  A community
   call concerning revocation of a port number (see below) MAY be
   considered, if a broader use of the port number is suspected.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.4" href="#section-8.4">8.4</a>.  Service Name and Port Number Revocation</span>

   A port number revocation can be thought of as an IANA-initiated de-
   assignment (<a href="#section-8.2">Section 8.2</a>), and has exactly the same effect on the
   registry.

   Sometimes, it will be clear that a specific port number is no longer
   in use and that IANA can revoke it and mark it as Reserved.  At other
   times, it may be unclear whether a given assigned port number is
   still in use somewhere in the Internet.  In those cases, IANA must
   carefully consider the consequences of revoking the port number, and
   SHOULD only do so if there is an overwhelming need.

   With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
   formulate a request to the IESG to issue a four-week community call
   concerning the pending port number revocation.  The IESG and IANA,
   with the Expert Reviewer's support, SHALL determine promptly after
   the end of the community call whether revocation should proceed, and
   then communicate their decision to the community.  This procedure
   typically involves similar steps to de-assignment except that it is
   initiated by IANA.

   Because there is much less danger of exhausting the service name
   space compared to the port number space, revoking service names is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.5" href="#section-8.5">8.5</a>.  Service Name and Port Number Transfers</span>

   The value of service names and port numbers is defined by their
   careful management as a shared Internet resource, whereas enabling
   transfer allows the potential for associated monetary exchanges.  As
   a result, the IETF does not permit service name or port number
   assignments to be transferred between parties, even when they are
   mutually consenting.

   The appropriate alternate procedure is a coordinated de-assignment
   and assignment: The new party requests the service name or port
   number via an assignment and the previous party releases its
   assignment via the de-assignment procedure outlined above.

   With the help of their IESG-appointed Expert Reviewer, IANA SHALL
   carefully determine if there is a valid technical, operational, or
   managerial reason to grant the requested new assignment.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.6" href="#section-8.6">8.6</a>.  Maintenance Issues</span>

   In addition to the formal procedures described above, updates to the
   Description and Contact information are coordinated by IANA in an
   informal manner, and may be initiated by either the Assignee or by
   IANA, e.g., by the latter requesting an update to current Contact
   information.  (Note that the Assignee cannot be changed as a separate
   procedure; see instead <a href="#section-8.5">Section 8.5</a> above.)

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-8.7" href="#section-8.7">8.7</a>.  Disagreements</span>

   In the case of disagreements around any request, there is the
   possibility of appeal following the normal appeals process for IANA
   assignments as defined by <a href="#section-7">Section 7</a> of "Guidelines for Writing an
   IANA Considerations Section in RFCs" [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-9" href="#section-9">9</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   The IANA guidelines described in this document do not change the
   security properties of UDP, TCP, SCTP, or DCCP.

   Assignment of a service name or port number does not in any way imply
   an endorsement of an application or product, and the fact that
   network traffic is flowing to or from an assigned port number does
   not mean that it is "good" traffic, or even that it is used by the
   assigned service.  Firewall and system administrators should choose
   how to configure their systems based on their knowledge of the
   traffic in question, not based on whether or not there is an assigned
   service name or port number.

   Services are expected to include support for security, either as
   default or dynamically negotiated in-band.  The use of separate
   service name or port number assignments for secure and insecure
   variants of the same service is to be avoided in order to discourage
   the deployment of insecure services.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-10" href="#section-10">10</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   This document obsoletes Sections <a href="#section-8">8</a> and <a href="#section-9.1">9.1</a> of the March 2000 IANA
   Allocation Guidelines [<a href="./rfc2780.html" title="&quot;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers&quot;">RFC2780</a>].

   Upon approval of this document for publication as an RFC, IANA worked
   with Stuart Cheshire, maintainer of the independent service name
   registry [<a href="#ref-SRVREG" title="&quot;DNS SRV Service Types Registry&quot;">SRVREG</a>], to merge the contents of that private registry
   into the official IANA registry.  The independent registry web page
   has been updated with pointers to the IANA registry and to this RFC.

   IANA created a new service name entry in the service name and port
   number registry [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>] for all entries in the Protocol and Service
   Names registry [<a href="#ref-PROTSERVREG" title="&quot;Protocol and Service Names Registry&quot;">PROTSERVREG</a>] that did not already have one assigned.

   IANA also indicates in the Assignment Notes for "www" and "www-http"
   that they are duplicate terms that refer to the "http" service, and
   should not be used for discovery purposes.  For this conceptual
   service (human-readable web pages served over HTTP), the correct
   service name to use for service discovery purposes is "http" (see
   <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-10.1" href="#section-10.1">10.1</a>.  Service Name Consistency</span>

   <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> defines which character strings are well-formed service
   names, which until now had not been clearly defined.  The definition
   in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> was chosen to allow maximum compatibility of service
   names with current and future service discovery mechanisms.

   As of August 5, 2009, approximately 98% of the so-called "Short
   Names" from existing port number assignments [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>] met the rules
   for legal service names stated in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a>, and hence for these
   services their service name is exactly the same as their "Short
   Name".

   The remaining approximately 2% of the existing "Short Names" are not
   suitable to be used directly as well-formed service names because
   they contain illegal characters such as asterisks, dots, pluses,
   slashes, or underscores.  All existing "Short Names" conform to the
   length requirement of 15 characters or fewer.  For these 96
   unsuitable "Short Names", listed in the table below, the service name
   is the Short Name with any illegal characters replaced by hyphens.
   IANA added an entry to the registry that uses the new well-formed
   primary service name for the existing service and that otherwise
   duplicates the original assignment information.  In the description
   field of this new entry giving the primary service name, IANA
   recorded that it has assigned a well-formed service name for the
   previous service and references the original assignment.  In the

   Assignment Notes field of the original assignment, IANA added a note
   that this entry is an alias to the new well-formed service name, and
   that the old service name is historic, not usable for use with many
   common service discovery mechanisms.

   There were four names recorded in IANA's Port Number Registry
   [<a href="#ref-PORTREG" title="&quot;Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">PORTREG</a>] that conflicted with names previously recorded in the ad
   hoc SRV name registry [<a href="#ref-SRVREG" title="&quot;DNS SRV Service Types Registry&quot;">SRVREG</a>]: esp, hydra, recipe, and xmp.

   The name conflicts were resolved amicably:

   The IANA Port Number Registry Short Name "esp" had been registered by
   Andrew Chernow, and he informed the authors that the port was no
   longer in use and the registration was no longer required.  The SRV
   registry entry for "esp" remains in effect.

   The SRV name "hydra" for SubEthaEdit had already been retired in
   favor of the new SRV name "see".  The IANA Port Number Registry entry
   for "hydra" remains in effect.

   The SRV name "recipe" was in use in an open source project that had
   not yet been packaged for distribution, and the registrant Daniel
   Taylor was willing to change to a different service name.  Thanks to
   Daniel Taylor for accommodating this change.  The IANA Port Number
   Registry entry for "recipe" remains in effect.

   The IANA Port Number Registry Short Name "xmp" had been registered by
   Bobby Krupczak, but since his registration included an assigned port
   number (which is still in use and remains unaffected by this change),
   he was willing to switch to a different service name.  Thanks to
   Bobby Krupczak for accommodating this change.  The SRV registry entry
   for "xmp" remains in effect.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-10.2" href="#section-10.2">10.2</a>.  Port Numbers for SCTP and DCCP Experimentation</span>

   Two System UDP and TCP ports, 1021 and 1022, have been reserved for
   experimental use [<a href="./rfc4727.html" title="&quot;Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers&quot;">RFC4727</a>].  This document assigns the same port
   numbers for SCTP and DCCP, updates the TCP and UDP assignments, and
   also instructs IANA to automatically assign these two port numbers
   for any future transport protocol with a similar 16-bit port number
   namespace.

   Note that these port numbers are meant for temporary experimentation
   and development in controlled environments.  Before using these port
   numbers, carefully consider the advice in <a href="#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> in this
   document, as well as in Sections <a href="#section-1">1</a> and <a href="#section-1.1">1.1</a> of "Assigning Experimental
   and Testing Numbers Considered Useful" [<a href="./rfc3692.html" title="&quot;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful&quot;">RFC3692</a>].  Most importantly,
   application developers must request a permanent port number
   assignment from IANA as described in <a href="#section-8.1">Section 8.1</a> before any kind of
   non-experimental deployment.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-10.3" href="#section-10.3">10.3</a>.  Updates to DCCP Registries</span>

   This document updates the IANA assignment procedures for the DCCP
   Port Number and DCCP Service Codes Registries [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>].

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-10.3.1" href="#section-10.3.1">10.3.1</a>.  DCCP Service Code Registry</span>

   Service codes are assigned on a "first come, first served" basis
   according to <a href="#section-19.8">Section 19.8</a> of the DCCP specification [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>].  This
   document updates that section by extending the guidelines given there
   in the following ways:

   o  IANA MAY assign new service codes without seeking "Expert Review"
      using their discretion, but SHOULD seek "Expert Review" if a
      request asks for more than five service codes.

   o  IANA should feel free to contact the DCCP Expert Reviewer with any
      questions related to requests for DCCP-related codepoints.

<span class="h4"><a class="selflink" name="section-10.3.2" href="#section-10.3.2">10.3.2</a>.  DCCP Port Numbers Registry</span>

   The DCCP ports registry is defined by <a href="#section-19.9">Section 19.9</a> of the DCCP
   specification [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>].  Assignments in this registry require prior
   assignment of a service code.  Not all service codes require IANA-
   assigned ports.  This document updates that section by extending the
   guidelines given there in the following way:

   o  IANA should normally assign a value in the range 1024-49151 to a
      DCCP server port.  IANA requests to assign port numbers in the
      System Ports range (0 through 1023) require an "IETF Review"
      [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>] prior to assignment by IANA [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>].

   o  IANA MUST NOT assign more than one DCCP server port to a single
      service code value.

   o  The assignment of multiple service codes to the same DCCP port is
      allowed, but subject to "Expert Review".

   o  The set of service code values associated with a DCCP server port
      should be recorded in the service name and port number registry.

   o  A request for additional service codes to be associated with an
      already assigned port number requires "Expert Review".  These
      requests will normally be accepted when they originate from the
      contact associated with the port assignment.  In other cases,
      these applications will be expected to use an unassigned port,
      when this is available.

   The DCCP specification [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>] notes that a short port name MUST be
   associated with each DCCP server port that has been assigned.  This
   document clarifies that this short port name is the service name as
   defined here, and this name MUST be unique.

        Recommendations on Using Assigned Transport Port Numbers

Abstract

   This document provides recommendations to designers of application
   and service protocols on how to use the transport protocol port
   number space and when to request a port assignment from IANA.  It
   provides designer guidance to requesters or users of port numbers on
   how to interact with IANA using the processes defined in <a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>;
   thus, this document complements (but does not update) that document.
   It provides guidelines for designers regarding how to interact with
   the IANA processes defined in <a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a>, thus serving to complement
   (but not update) that document.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   This document provides information and advice to application and
   service designers on the use of assigned transport port numbers.  It
   provides a detailed historical background of the evolution of
   transport port numbers and their multiple meanings.  It also provides
   specific recommendations to designers on how to use assigned port


   numbers.  Note that this document provides information to potential
   port number applicants that complements the IANA process described in
   [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>] (the sole document of <a href="./bcp165.html">BCP 165</a> before this document), but it
   does not change any of the port number assignment procedures
   described therein.  Because they are thus so closely related, this
   document and <a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a> are now known together as <a href="./bcp165.html">BCP 165</a>.  This
   document is intended to address concerns typically raised during
   Expert Review (see [<a href="./rfc5226.html" title="&quot;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs&quot;">RFC5226</a>]) of assigned port number applications,
   but it is not intended to bind those reviews.  <a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a> also
   describes the interaction between port experts and port requests in
   IETF consensus documents.  Authors of IETF consensus documents should
   nevertheless follow the advice in this document and can expect
   comment on their port requests from the port experts during IETF Last
   Call or at other times when review is explicitly sought.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="./rfc2119.html" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">RFC2119</a>].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lowercase uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in <a href="./rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a>.

   In this document, the characters "&gt;&gt;" preceding an indented line(s)
   indicates a statement using the key words listed above.  This
   convention aids reviewers in quickly identifying or finding
   requirements for registration and recommendations for use of port
   numbers in this RFC.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  History</span>

   The term 'port' was first used in [<a href="./rfc33.html" title="&quot;New Host-Host Protocol&quot;">RFC33</a>] to indicate a simplex
   communication path from an individual process and originally applied
   to only the Network Control Program (NCP) connection-oriented
   protocol.  At a meeting described in [<a href="./rfc37.html" title="&quot;Network Meeting Epilogue, etc&quot;">RFC37</a>], an idea was presented
   to decouple connections between processes and links that they use as
   paths and, thus, to include numeric source and destination socket

   identifiers in packets.  [<a href="./rfc38.html" title="&quot;Comments on Network Protocol from NWG/RFC #36&quot;">RFC38</a>] provides further detail, describing
   how processes might have more than one of these paths and that more
   than one path may be active at a time.  As a result, there was the
   need to add a process identifier to the header of each message so
   that incoming messages could be demultiplexed to the appropriate
   process.  [<a href="./rfc38.html" title="&quot;Comments on Network Protocol from NWG/RFC #36&quot;">RFC38</a>] further suggests that 32-bit numbers be used for
   these identifiers.  [<a href="./rfc48.html" title="&quot;Possible protocol plateau&quot;">RFC48</a>] discusses the current notion of listening
   on a specific port number, but does not discuss the issue of port
   number determination.  [<a href="./rfc61.html" title="&quot;Note on Interprocess Communication in a Resource Sharing Computer Network&quot;">RFC61</a>] notes that the challenge of knowing
   the appropriate port numbers is "left to the processes" in general,
   but introduces the concept of a "well-known" port number for common
   services.

   [<a name="ref-RFC76" id="ref-RFC76">RFC76</a>] proposes a "telephone book" by which an index will allow port
   numbers to be used by name, but still assumes that both source and
   destination port numbers are fixed by such a system.  [<a href="./rfc333.html" title="&quot;Proposed experiment with a Message Switching Protocol&quot;">RFC333</a>]
   proposes that a port number pair, rather than an individual port
   number, be used on both sides of the connection for demultiplexing
   messages.  This is the final view in [<a href="./rfc793.html" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">RFC793</a>] (and its predecessors,
   including [<a href="#ref-IEN112" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">IEN112</a>]), and brings us to their current meaning.
   [<a href="./rfc739.html" title="&quot;Assigned numbers&quot;">RFC739</a>] introduces the notion of generic reserved port numbers for
   groups of protocols, such as "any private RJE server" [<a href="./rfc739.html" title="&quot;Assigned numbers&quot;">RFC739</a>].
   Although the overall range of such port numbers was (and remains) 16
   bits, only the first 256 (high 8 bits cleared) in the range were
   considered assigned.

   [<a name="ref-RFC758" id="ref-RFC758">RFC758</a>] is the first to describe port numbers as being used for TCP
   (previous RFCs all refer to only NCP).  It includes a list of such
   well-known port numbers, as well as describes ranges used for
   different purposes:

      Decimal   Octal     Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      0-63      0-77      Network Wide Standard Function
      64-127    100-177   Hosts Specific Functions
      128-223   200-337   Reserved for Future Use
      224-255   340-377   Any Experimental Function

   In [<a href="./rfc820.html" title="&quot;Assigned numbers&quot;">RFC820</a>], those range meanings disappear, and a single list of
   number assignments is presented.  This is also the first time that
   port numbers are described as applying to a connectionless transport
   (e.g., UDP) rather than only connection-oriented transports.

   By [<a href="./rfc900.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC900</a>], the ranges appear as decimal numbers rather than the
   octal ranges used previously.  [<a href="./rfc1340.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1340</a>] increases this range from
   0-255 to 0-1023 and begins to list TCP and UDP port number
   assignments individually (although the assumption was that once
   assigned a port number applies to all transport protocols, including

   TCP, UDP, recently Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and
   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), as well as ISO-TP4 for a
   brief period in the early 1990s).  [<a href="./rfc1340.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1340</a>] also establishes the
   Registered range of 1024-59151, though it notes that it is not
   controlled by the IANA (at that point).  The list provided by
   [<a href="./rfc1700.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers&quot;">RFC1700</a>] in 1994 remained the standard until it was declared
   replaced by an online version, as of [<a href="./rfc3232.html" title="&quot;Assigned Numbers: RFC 1700 is Replaced by an On-line Database&quot;">RFC3232</a>] in 2002.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Current Port Number Use</span>

   <a href="./rfc6335.html">RFC 6335</a> indicates three ranges of port number assignments:

      Binary         Hex
      -----------------------------------------------------------
      0-1023         0x0000-0x03FF  System (also Well-Known)
      1024-49151     0x0400-0xBFFF  User (also Registered)
      49152-65535    0xC000-0xFFFF  Dynamic (also Private)

   System (also Well-Known) encompasses the range 0-1023.  On some
   systems, use of these port numbers requires privileged access, e.g.,
   that the process run as 'root' (i.e., as a privileged user), which is
   why these are referred to as System port numbers.  The port numbers
   from 1024-49151 denotes non-privileged services, known as User (also
   Registered), because these port numbers do not run with special
   privileges.  Dynamic (also Private) port numbers are not assigned.

   Both System and User port numbers are assigned through IANA, so both
   are sometimes called 'registered port numbers'.  As a result, the
   term 'registered' is ambiguous, referring either to the entire range
   0-49151 or to the User port numbers.  Complicating matters further,
   System port numbers do not always require special (i.e., 'root')
   privilege.  For clarity, the remainder of this document refers to the
   port number ranges as System, User, and Dynamic, to be consistent
   with IANA process [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  What is a Port Number?</span>

   A port number is a 16-bit number used for two distinct purposes:

   o  Demultiplexing transport endpoint associations within an end host

   o  Identifying a service

   The first purpose requires that each transport endpoint association
   (e.g., TCP connection or UDP pairwise association) using a given
   transport between a given pair of IP addresses use a different pair
   of port numbers, but it does not require either coordination or




<span class="grey">Touch                     Best Current Practice                 [Page 5]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-2-6" id="page-2-6" href="#page-2-6" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7605.html">RFC 7605</a>         Recommendations for Transport Port Use      August 2015</span>


   registration of port number use.  It is the second purpose that
   drives the need for a common registry.

   Consider a user wanting to run a web server.  That service could run
   on any port number, provided that all clients knew what port number
   to use to access that service at that host.  Such information can be
   explicitly distributed -- for example, by putting it in the URI:

      <a href="http://www.example.com:51509/">http://www.example.com:51509/</a>

   Ultimately, the correlation of a service with a port number is an
   agreement between just the two endpoints of the association.  A web
   server can run on port number 53, which might appear as DNS traffic
   to others but will connect to browsers that know to use port number
   53 rather than 80.

   As a concept, a service is the combination of ISO Layers 5-7 that
   represents an application-protocol capability.  For example, www
   (port number 80) is a service that uses HTTP as an application
   protocol and provides access to a web server [<a href="./rfc7230.html" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing&quot;">RFC7230</a>].  However, it
   is possible to use HTTP for other purposes, such as command and
   control.  This is why some current services (HTTP, e.g.) are a bit
   overloaded -- they describe not only the application protocol, but a
   particular service.

   IANA assigns port numbers so that Internet endpoints do not need
   pairwise, explicit coordination of the meaning of their port numbers.
   This is the primary reason for requesting port number assignment by
   IANA -- to have a common agreement between all endpoints on the
   Internet as to the default meaning of a port number, which provides
   the endpoints with a default port number for a particular protocol or
   service.

   Port numbers are sometimes used by intermediate devices on a network
   path, either to monitor available services, to monitor traffic (e.g.,
   to indicate the data contents), or to intercept traffic (to block,
   proxy, relay, aggregate, or otherwise process it).  In each case, the
   intermediate device interprets traffic based on the port number.  It
   is important to recognize that any interpretation of port numbers --
   except at the endpoints -- may be incorrect, because port numbers are
   meaningful only at the endpoints.  Further, port numbers may not be
   visible to these intermediate devices, such as when the transport
   protocol is encrypted (as in network- or link-layer tunnels) or when
   a packet is fragmented (in which case only the first fragment has the
   port number information).  Such port number invisibility may
   interfere with these capabilities, which are implemented inside the
   network and based on a port number.

   Port numbers can also be used for other purposes.  Assigned port
   numbers can simplify end-system configuration, so that individual
   installations do not need to coordinate their use of arbitrary port
   numbers.  Such assignments may also have the effect of simplifying
   firewall management, so that a single, fixed firewall configuration
   can either permit or deny a service that uses the assigned ports.

   It is useful to differentiate a port number from a service name.  The
   former is a numeric value that is used directly in transport protocol
   headers as a demultiplexing and service identifier.  The latter is
   primarily a user convenience, where the default map between the two
   is considered static and resolved using a cached index.  This
   document focuses on the former because it is the fundamental network
   resource.  Dynamic maps between the two, i.e., using DNS SRV records,
   are discussed further in <a href="#section-7.1">Section 7.1</a>.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Conservation</span>

   Assigned port numbers are a limited resource that is globally shared
   by the entire Internet community.  As of 2014, approximately 5850 TCP
   and 5570 UDP port numbers had been assigned out of a total range of
   49151.  As a result of past conservation, current assigned port use
   is small and the current rate of assignment avoids the need for
   transition to larger number spaces.  This conservation also helps
   avoid the need for IANA to rely on assigned port number reclamation,
   which is practically impossible even though procedurally permitted
   [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].

   IANA aims to assign only one port number per service, including
   variants [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>], but there are other benefits to using fewer port
   numbers for a given service.  Use of multiple assigned port numbers
   can make applications more fragile, especially when firewalls block a
   subset of those port numbers or use ports numbers to route or
   prioritize traffic differently.  As a result:

   &gt;&gt; Each assigned port requested MUST be justified by the applicant as
   an independently useful service.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.1" href="#section-6.1">6.1</a>.  Guiding Principles</span>

   This document provides recommendations for users that also help
   conserve assigned port number space.  Again, this document does not
   update [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>] (originally the sole document of <a href="./bcp165.html">BCP 165</a>), which
   describes the IANA procedures for managing assigned transport port
   numbers and services, but rather augments it by now becoming part of
   <a href="./bcp165.html">BCP 165</a> (i.e., <a href="./bcp165.html">BCP 165</a> now refers to both documents together).
   Assigned port number conservation is based on a number of basic

   o  A single assigned port number can support different functions over
      separate endpoint associations, determined using in-band
      information.  An FTP data connection can transfer binary or text
      files, the latter translating line-terminators, as indicated in-
      band over the control port number [<a href="./rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC959</a>].

   o  A single assigned port number can indicate the Dynamic port
      number(s) on which different capabilities are supported, as with
      passive-mode FTP [<a href="./rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC959</a>].

   o  Several existing services can indicate the Dynamic port number(s)
      on which other services are supported, such as with Multicast DNS
      (mDNS) and portmapper [<a href="./rfc1833.html" title="&quot;Binding Protocols for ONC RPC Version 2&quot;">RFC1833</a>] [<a href="./rfc6762.html" title="&quot;Multicast DNS&quot;">RFC6762</a>] [<a href="./rfc6763.html" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">RFC6763</a>].

   o  Copies of some existing services can be differentiated using in-
      band information (e.g., URIs in the HTTP Host field and TLS Server
      Name Indication extension) [<a href="./rfc7230.html" title="&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing&quot;">RFC7230</a>] [<a href="./rfc6066.html" title="&quot;Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension Definitions&quot;">RFC6066</a>].

   o  Services requiring varying performance properties can already be
      supported using separate endpoint associations (connections or
      other associations), each configured to support the desired
      properties.  For example, a high-speed and low-speed variant can
      be determined within the service using the same assigned port.

   Assigned port numbers are intended to differentiate services, not
   variations of performance, replicas, pairwise endpoint associations,
   or payload types.  Assigned port numbers are also a small space
   compared to other Internet number spaces; it is never appropriate to
   consume assigned port numbers to conserve larger spaces such as IP
   addresses, especially where copies of a service represent different
   endpoints.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-6.2" href="#section-6.2">6.2</a>.  Firewall and NAT Considerations</span>

   Ultimately, port numbers indicate services only to the endpoints, and
   any intermediate device that assigns meaning to a value can be
   incorrect.  End systems might agree to run web services (HTTP) over
   port number 53 (typically used for DNS) rather than port number 80,
   at which point a firewall that blocks port number 80 but permits port
   number 53 would not have the desired effect.  Nonetheless, assigned
   port numbers are often used to help configure firewalls and other
   port-based systems for access control.

   Using Dynamic port numbers, or explicitly indicated port numbers
   indicated in-band over another service (such as with FTP) often
   complicates firewall and NAT interactions [<a href="./rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC959</a>].  FTP over
   firewalls often requires direct support for deep-packet inspection
   (to snoop for the Dynamic port number for the NAT to correctly map)

   client side).

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Considerations for Requesting Port Number Assignments</span>

   Port numbers are assigned by IANA by a set of documented procedures
   [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  The following section describes the steps users can take
   to help assist with responsible use of assigned port numbers and with
   preparing an application for a port number assignment.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.1" href="#section-7.1">7.1</a>.  Is a port number assignment necessary?</span>

   First, it is useful to consider whether a port number assignment is
   required.  In many cases, a new number assignment may not be needed.
   The following questions may aid in making this determination:

   o  Is this really a new service or could an existing service suffice?

   o  Is this an experimental service [<a href="./rfc3692.html" title="&quot;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful&quot;">RFC3692</a>]?  If so, consider using
      the current experimental ports [<a href="./rfc2780.html" title="&quot;IANA Allocation Guidelines For Values In the Internet Protocol and Related Headers&quot;">RFC2780</a>].

   o  Is this service independently useful?  Some systems are composed
      from collections of different service capabilities, but not all
      component functions are useful as independent services.  Port
      numbers are typically shared among the smallest independently
      useful set of functions.  Different service uses or properties can
      be supported in separate pairwise endpoint associations after an
      initial negotiation, e.g., to support software decomposition.

   o  Can this service use a Dynamic port number that is coordinated
      out-of-band?  For example:

      o  By explicit configuration of both endpoints.

      o  By internal mechanisms within the same host (e.g., a
         configuration file, indicated within a URI or using
         interprocess communication).

      o  Using information exchanged on a related service: FTP [<a href="./rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC959</a>],
         SIP [<a href="./rfc3261.html" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>], etc.

      o  Using an existing port discovery service: portmapper [<a href="./rfc1833.html" title="&quot;Binding Protocols for ONC RPC Version 2&quot;">RFC1833</a>],
         mDNS [<a href="./rfc6762.html" title="&quot;Multicast DNS&quot;">RFC6762</a>] [<a href="./rfc6763.html" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">RFC6763</a>], etc.

   There are a few good examples of reasons that more directly suggest
   that not only is a port number assignment not necessary, but it is
   directly counter-indicated:

   o  Assigned port numbers are not intended to differentiate
      performance variations within the same service, e.g., high-speed
      versus ordinary speed.  Performance variations can be supported
      within a single assigned port number in context of separate
      pairwise endpoint associations.

   o  Additional assigned port numbers are not intended to replicate an
      existing service.  For example, if a device is configured to use a
      typical web browser, then the port number used for that service is
      a copy of the http service that is already assigned to port number
      80 and does not warrant a new assignment.  However, an automated
      system that happens to use HTTP framing -- but is not primarily
      accessed by a browser -- might be a new service.  A good way to
      tell is to ask, "Can an unmodified client of the existing service
      interact with the proposed service?".  If so, that service would
      be a copy of an existing service and would not merit a new
      assignment.

   o  Assigned port numbers not intended for intra-machine
      communication.  Such communication can already be supported by
      internal mechanisms (interprocess communication, shared memory,
      shared files, etc.).  When Internet communication within a host is
      desired, the server can bind to a Dynamic port that is indicated
      to the client using these internal mechanisms.

   o  Separate assigned port numbers are not intended for insecure
      versions of existing (or new) secure services.  A service that
      already requires security would be made more vulnerable by having
      the same capability accessible without security.

      Note that the converse is different, i.e., it can be useful to
      create a new, secure service that replicates an existing insecure
      service on a new port number assignment.  This can be necessary
      when the existing service is not backward-compatible with security
      enhancements, such as the use of TLS [<a href="./rfc5246.html" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>] or DTLS [<a href="./rfc6347.html" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2&quot;">RFC6347</a>].

   o  Assigned port numbers are not intended for indicating different
      service versions.  Version differentiation should be handled in-
      band, e.g., using a version number at the beginning of an
      association (e.g., connection or other transaction).  This may not
      be possible with legacy assignments, but all new services should
      incorporate support for version indication.





<span class="grey">Touch                     Best Current Practice                [Page 10]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7605.html">RFC 7605</a>         Recommendations for Transport Port Use      August 2015</span>


   Some services may not need assigned port numbers at all, e.g., SIP
   allows voice calls to use Dynamic ports [<a href="./rfc3261.html" title="&quot;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol&quot;">RFC3261</a>].  Some systems can
   register services in the DNS, using SRV entries.  These services can
   be discovered by a variety of means, including mDNS, or via direct
   query [<a href="./rfc6762.html" title="&quot;Multicast DNS&quot;">RFC6762</a>] [<a href="./rfc6763.html" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">RFC6763</a>].  In such cases, users can more easily
   request an SRV name, which are assigned first-come, first-served from
   a much larger namespace.

   IANA assigns port numbers, but this assignment is typically used only
   for servers, i.e., the host that listens for incoming connections or
   other associations.  Clients, i.e., hosts that initiate connections
   or other associations, typically refer to those assigned port numbers
   but do not need port number assignments for their endpoint.

   Finally, an assigned port number is not a guarantee of exclusive use.
   Traffic for any service might appear on any port number, due to
   misconfiguration or deliberate misuse.  Application and service
   designers are encouraged to validate traffic based on its content.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.2" href="#section-7.2">7.2</a>.  How many assigned port numbers are necessary?</span>

   As noted earlier, systems might require a single port number
   assignment, but rarely require multiple port numbers.  There are a
   variety of known ways to reduce assigned port number consumption.
   Although some may be cumbersome or inefficient, they are nearly
   always preferable to consuming additional port number assignments.

   Such techniques include:

   o  Use of a discovery service, either a shared service (mDNS) or a
      discovery service for a given system [<a href="./rfc6762.html" title="&quot;Multicast DNS&quot;">RFC6762</a>] [<a href="./rfc6763.html" title="&quot;DNS-Based Service Discovery&quot;">RFC6763</a>].

   o  Multiplex packet types using in-band information, either on a per-
      message or per-connection basis.  Such demultiplexing can even
      hand off different messages and connections among different
      processes, such as is done with FTP [<a href="./rfc959.html" title="&quot;File Transfer Protocol&quot;">RFC959</a>].

   There are some cases where NAT and firewall traversal are
   significantly improved by having an assigned port number.  Although
   NAT traversal protocols supporting automatic configuration have been
   proposed and developed (e.g., Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
   (STUN) [<a href="./rfc5389.html" title="&quot;Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5389</a>], Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [<a href="./rfc5766.html" title="&quot;Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN): Relay Extensions to Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)&quot;">RFC5766</a>],
   and Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [<a href="./rfc5245.html" title="&quot;Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols&quot;">RFC5245</a>]), not all
   application and service designers can rely on their presence as of
   yet.

   In the past, some services were assigned multiple port numbers or
   sometimes fairly large port ranges (e.g., X11).  This occurred for a
   variety of reasons: port number conservation was not as widely
   appreciated, assignments were not as ardently reviewed, etc.  This no
   longer reflects current practice and such assignments are not
   considered to constitute a precedent for future assignments.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.3" href="#section-7.3">7.3</a>.  Picking an Assigned Port Number</span>

   Given a demonstrated need for a port number assignment, the next
   question is how to pick the desired port number.  An application for
   a port number assignment does not need to include a desired port
   number; in that case, IANA will select from those currently
   available.

   Users should consider whether the requested port number is important.
   For example, would an assignment be acceptable if IANA picked the
   port number value?  Would a TCP (or other transport protocol) port
   number assignment be useful by itself?  If so, a port number can be
   assigned to a service for one transport protocol where it is already
   (or can be subsequently) assigned to a different service for other
   transport protocols.

   The most critical issue in picking a number is selecting the desired
   range, i.e., System versus User port numbers.  The distinction was
   intended to indicate a difference in privilege; originally, System
   port numbers required privileged ('root') access, while User port
   numbers did not.  That distinction has since blurred because some
   current systems do not limit access control to System port numbers
   and because some System services have been replicated on User numbers
   (e.g., IRC).  Even so, System port number assignments have continued
   at an average rate of 3-4 per year over the past 7 years (2007-2013),
   indicating that the desire to keep this distinction continues.

   As a result, the difference between System and User port numbers
   needs to be treated with caution.  Developers are advised to treat
   services as if they are always run without privilege.

   Even when developers seek a System port number assignment, it may be
   very difficult to obtain.  System port number assignment requires
   IETF Review or IESG Approval and justification that both User and
   Dynamic port number ranges are insufficient [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  Thus, this
   document recommends both:

   &gt;&gt; Developers SHOULD NOT apply for System port number assignments
   because the increased privilege they are intended to provide is not
   always enforced.




<span class="grey">Touch                     Best Current Practice                [Page 12]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-2-13" id="page-2-13" href="#page-2-13" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7605.html">RFC 7605</a>         Recommendations for Transport Port Use      August 2015</span>


   &gt;&gt; System implementers SHOULD enforce the need for privilege for
   processes to listen on System port numbers.

   At some future date, it might be useful to deprecate the distinction
   between System and User port numbers altogether.  Services typically
   require elevated ('root') privileges to bind to a System port number,
   but many such services go to great lengths to immediately drop those
   privileges just after connection or other association establishment
   to reduce the impact of an attack using their capabilities.  Such
   services might be more securely operated on User port numbers than on
   System port numbers.  Further, if System port numbers were no longer
   assigned, as of 2014 it would cost only 180 of the 1024 System values
   (17%), or 180 of the overall 49152 assigned (System and User) values
   (&lt;0.04%).

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.4" href="#section-7.4">7.4</a>.  Support for Security</span>

   Just as a service is a way to obtain information or processing from a
   host over a network, a service can also be the opening through which
   to compromise that host.  Protecting a service involves security,
   which includes integrity protection, source authentication, privacy,
   or any combination of these capabilities.  Security can be provided
   in a number of ways, and thus:

   &gt;&gt; New services SHOULD support security capabilities, either directly
   or via a content protection such as TLS [<a href="./rfc5246.html" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>] or Datagram TLS
   (DTLS) [<a href="./rfc6347.html" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2&quot;">RFC6347</a>], or transport protection such as the TCP-AO
   [<a href="./rfc5925.html" title="&quot;The TCP Authentication Option&quot;">RFC5925</a>].  Insecure versions of new or existing secure services
   SHOULD be avoided because of the new vulnerability they create.

   Secure versions of legacy services that are not already security-
   capable via in-band negotiations can be very useful.  However, there
   is no IETF consensus on when separate ports should be used for secure
   and insecure variants of the same service [<a href="./rfc2595.html" title="&quot;Using TLS with IMAP, POP3 and ACAP&quot;">RFC2595</a>] [<a href="./rfc2817.html" title="&quot;Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1&quot;">RFC2817</a>]
   [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  The overall preference is for use of a single port, as
   noted in <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> of this document and <a href="./rfc6335.html#section-7.2">Section&nbsp;7.2 of [RFC6335]</a>, but
   the appropriate approach depends on the specific characteristics of
   the service.  As a result:

   &gt;&gt; When requesting both secure and insecure port assignments for the
   same service, justification is expected for the utility and safety of
   each port as an independent service (<a href="#section-6">Section 6</a>).  Precedent (e.g.,
   citing other protocols that use a separate insecure port) is
   inadequate justification by itself.







<span class="grey">Touch                     Best Current Practice                [Page 13]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint' style='width: 96ex;' align='left'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><a name="page-2-14" id="page-2-14" href="#page-2-14" class="invisible"> </a>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7605.html">RFC 7605</a>         Recommendations for Transport Port Use      August 2015</span>


   It's also important to recognize that port number assignment is not
   itself a guarantee that traffic using that number provides the
   corresponding service or that a given service is always offered only
   on its assigned port number.  Port numbers are ultimately meaningful
   only between endpoints and any service can be run on any port.  Thus:

   &gt;&gt; Security SHOULD NOT rely on assigned port number distinctions
   alone; every service, whether secure or not, is likely to be
   attacked.

   Applications for a new service that requires both a secure and
   insecure port may be found, on Expert Review, to be unacceptable, and
   may not be approved for allocation.  Similarly, an application for a
   new port to support an insecure variant of an existing secure
   protocol may be found unacceptable.  In both cases, the resulting
   security of the service in practice will be a significant
   consideration in the decision as to whether to assign an insecure
   port.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.5" href="#section-7.5">7.5</a>.  Support for Future Versions</span>

   Requests for assigned port numbers are expected to support multiple
   versions on the same assigned port number [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  Versions are
   typically indicated in-band, either at the beginning of a connection
   or other association or in each protocol message.

   &gt;&gt; Version support SHOULD be included in new services rather than
   relying on different port number assignments for different versions.

   &gt;&gt; Version numbers SHOULD NOT be included in either the service name
   or service description, to avoid the need to make additional port
   number assignments for future variants of a service.

   Again, the assigned port number space is far too limited to be used
   as an indicator of protocol version or message type.  Although this
   has happened in the past (e.g., for NFS), it should be avoided in new
   requests.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.6" href="#section-7.6">7.6</a>.  Transport Protocols</span>

   IANA assigns port numbers specific to one or more transport
   protocols, typically UDP [<a href="./rfc768.html" title="&quot;User Datagram Protocol&quot;">RFC768</a>] and TCP [<a href="./rfc793.html" title="&quot;Transmission Control Protocol&quot;">RFC793</a>], but also SCTP
   [<a href="./rfc4960.html" title="&quot;Stream Control Transmission Protocol&quot;">RFC4960</a>], DCCP [<a href="./rfc4340.html" title="&quot;Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)&quot;">RFC4340</a>], and any other standard transport protocol.
   Originally, IANA port number assignments were concurrent for both UDP
   and TCP, and other transports were not indicated.  However, to
   conserve the assigned port number space and to reflect increasing use
   of other transports, assignments are now specific only to the
   transport being used.



<span class="grey">Touch                     Best Current Practice                [Page 14]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc7605.html">RFC 7605</a>         Recommendations for Transport Port Use      August 2015</span>


   In general, a service should request assignments for multiple
   transports using the same service name and description on the same
   port number only when they all reflect essentially the same service.
   Good examples of such use are DNS and NFS, where the difference
   between the UDP and TCP services are specific to supporting each
   transport.  For example, the UDP variant of a service might add
   sequence numbers and the TCP variant of the same service might add
   in-band message delimiters.  This document does not describe the
   appropriate selection of a transport protocol for a service.

   &gt;&gt; Service names and descriptions for multiple transport port number
   assignments SHOULD match only when they describe the same service,
   excepting only enhancements for each supported transport.

   When the services differ, it may be acceptable or preferable to use
   the same port number, but the service names and descriptions should
   be different for each transport/service pair, reflecting the
   differences in the services.  For example, if TCP is used for the
   basic control protocol and UDP for an alarm protocol, then the
   services might be "name-ctl" and "name-alarm".  A common example is
   when TCP is used for a service and UDP is used to determine whether
   that service is active (e.g., via a unicast, broadcast, or multicast
   test message) [<a href="./rfc1122.html" title="&quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers&quot;">RFC1122</a>].  IANA has, for several years, used the
   suffix "-disc" in service names to distinguish discovery services,
   such as are used to identify endpoints capable of a given service.

   &gt;&gt; Names of discovery services SHOULD use an identifiable suffix; the
   suggestion is "-disc".

   Some services are used for discovery, either in conjunction with a
   TCP service or as a stand-alone capability.  Such services will be
   more reliable when using multicast rather than broadcast (over IPv4)
   because IP routers do not forward "all nodes" broadcasts (all 1's,
   i.e., 255.255.255.255 for IPv4) and have not been required to support
   subnet-directed broadcasts since 1999 [<a href="./rfc1812.html" title="&quot;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers&quot;">RFC1812</a>] [<a href="./rfc2644.html" title="&quot;Changing the Default for Directed Broadcasts in Routers&quot;">RFC2644</a>].

   This issue is relevant only for IPv4 because IPv6 does not support
   broadcast.

   &gt;&gt; UDP over IPv4 multi-host services SHOULD use multicast rather than
   broadcast.

   Designers should be very careful in creating services over transports
   that do not support congestion control or error recovery, notably
   UDP.  There are several issues that should be considered in such
   cases, as summarized in Table 1 in [<a href="./rfc5405.html" title="&quot;Unicast UDP Usage Guidelines for Application Designers&quot;">RFC5405</a>].  In addition, the
   following recommendations apply to service design:

   &gt;&gt; Services that use multipoint communication SHOULD be scalable and
   SHOULD NOT rely solely on the efficiency of multicast transmission
   for scalability.

   &gt;&gt; Services SHOULD NOT use UDP as a performance enhancement over TCP,
   e.g., to circumnavigate TCP's congestion control.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.7" href="#section-7.7">7.7</a>.  When to Request an Assignment</span>

   Assignments are typically requested when a user has enough
   information to reasonably answer the questions in the IANA
   application.  IANA applications typically take up to a few weeks to
   process, with some complex cases taking up to a month.  The process
   typically involves a few exchanges between the IANA Ports Expert
   Review team and the applicant.

   An application needs to include a description of the service, as well
   as to address key questions designed to help IANA determine whether
   the assignment is justified.  The application should be complete and
   not refer solely to an Internet-Draft, RFC, website, or any other
   external documentation.

   Services that are independently developed can be requested at any
   time, but are typically best requested in the last stages of design
   and initial experimentation, before any deployment has occurred that
   cannot easily be updated.

   &gt;&gt; Users MUST NOT deploy implementations that use assigned port
   numbers prior their assignment by IANA.

   &gt;&gt; Users MUST NOT deploy implementations that default to using the
   experimental System port numbers (1021 and 1022 [<a href="./rfc4727.html" title="&quot;Experimental Values In IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, UDP, and TCP Headers&quot;">RFC4727</a>]) outside a
   controlled environment where they can be updated with a subsequent
   assigned port [<a href="./rfc3692.html" title="&quot;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful&quot;">RFC3692</a>].

   Deployments that use unassigned port numbers before assignment
   complicate IANA management of the port number space.  Keep in mind
   that this recommendation protects existing assignees, users of
   current services, and applicants for new assignments; it helps ensure
   that a desired number and service name are available when assigned.
   The list of currently unassigned numbers is just that -- *currently*
   unassigned.  It does not reflect pending applications.  Waiting for
   an official IANA assignment reduces the chance that an assignment
   request will conflict with another deployed service.

   Applications made through Internet-Draft posting or RFC publication
   (in any stream) typically use a placeholder ("PORTNUM") in the text,
   and implementations use an experimental port number until a final

   assignment has been made [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  That assignment is initially
   indicated in the IANA Considerations section of the document, which
   is tracked by the RFC Editor.  When a document has been approved for
   publication, that request is forwarded to IANA for handling.  IANA
   will make the new assignment accordingly.  At that time, IANA may
   also request that the applicant fill out the application form on
   their website, e.g., when the RFC does not directly address the
   information expected as per [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  "Early" assignments can be
   made when justified, e.g., for early interoperability testing,
   according to existing process [<a href="./rfc7120.html" title="&quot;Early IANA Allocation of Standards Track Code Points&quot;">RFC7120</a>] [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].

   &gt;&gt; Users writing specifications SHOULD use symbolic names for port
   numbers and service names until an IANA assignment has been
   completed.  Implementations SHOULD use experimental port numbers
   during this time, but those numbers MUST NOT be cited in
   documentation except as interim.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.8" href="#section-7.8">7.8</a>.  Squatting</span>

   "Squatting" describes the use of a number from the assignable range
   in deployed software without IANA assignment for that use, regardless
   of whether the number has been assigned or remains available for
   assignment.  It is hazardous because IANA cannot track such usage and
   thus cannot avoid making legitimate assignments that conflict with
   such unauthorized usage.

   Such "squatted" port numbers remain unassigned, and IANA retains the
   right to assign them when requested by other applicants.  Application
   and service designers are reminded that is never appropriate to use
   port numbers that have not been directly assigned [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].  In
   particular, any unassigned code from the assigned ranges will be
   assigned by IANA, and any conflict will be easily resolved as the
   protocol designer's fault once that happens (because they would not
   be the assignee).  This may reflect in the public's judgment on the
   quality of their expertise and cooperation with the Internet
   community.

   Regardless, there are numerous services that have squatted on such
   numbers that are in widespread use.  Designers who are using such
   port numbers are encouraged to apply for an assignment.  Note that
   even widespread de facto use may not justify a later IANA assignment
   of that value, especially if either the value has already been
   assigned to a legitimate applicant or if the service would not
   qualify for an assignment of its own accord.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-7.9" href="#section-7.9">7.9</a>.  Other Considerations</span>

   As noted earlier, System port numbers should be used sparingly, and
   it is better to avoid them altogether.  This avoids the potentially
   incorrect assumption that the service on such port numbers run in a
   privileged mode.

   Assigned port numbers are not intended to be changed; this includes
   the corresponding service name.  Once deployed, it can be very
   difficult to recall every implementation, so the assignment should be
   retained.  However, in cases where the current assignee of a name or
   number has reasonable knowledge of the impact on such uses, and is
   willing to accept that impact, the name or number of an assignment
   can be changed [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>]

   Aliases, or multiple service names for the same assigned port number,
   are no longer considered appropriate [<a href="./rfc6335.html" title="&quot;Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Procedures for the Management of the Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry&quot;">RFC6335</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   This document focuses on the issues arising when designing services
   that require new port assignments.  <a href="#section-7.4">Section 7.4</a> addresses the
   security and security-related issues of that interaction.

   When designing a secure service, the use of TLS [<a href="./rfc5246.html" title="&quot;The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2&quot;">RFC5246</a>], DTLS
   [<a href="./rfc6347.html" title="&quot;Datagram Transport Layer Security Version 1.2&quot;">RFC6347</a>], or TCP-AO [<a href="./rfc5925.html" title="&quot;The TCP Authentication Option&quot;">RFC5925</a>] mechanisms that protect transport
   protocols or their contents is encouraged.  It may not be possible to
   use IPsec [<a href="./rfc4301.html" title="&quot;Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol&quot;">RFC4301</a>] in similar ways because of the different
   relationship between IPsec and port numbers and because applications
   may not be aware of IPsec protections.

   This document reminds application and service designers that port
   numbers do not protect against denial-of-service attack or guarantee
   that traffic should be trusted.  Using assigned numbers for port
   filtering isn't a substitute for authentication, encryption, and
   integrity protection.  The port number alone should not be used to
   avoid denial-of-service attacks or to manage firewall traffic because
   the use of port numbers is not regulated or validated.

   The use of assigned port numbers is the antithesis of privacy because
   they are intended to explicitly indicate the desired application or
   service.  Strictly, port numbers are meaningful only at the
   endpoints, so any interpretation elsewhere in the network can be
   arbitrarily incorrect.  However, those numbers can also expose
   information about available services on a given host.  This
   information can be used by intermediate devices to monitor and
