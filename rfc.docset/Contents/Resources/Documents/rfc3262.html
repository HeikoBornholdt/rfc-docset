   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (<a href="./rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a> [<a href="#ref-1" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>1</a>]) is a request-
   response protocol for initiating and managing communications
   sessions.  SIP defines two types of responses, provisional and final.
   Final responses convey the result of the request processing, and are
   sent reliably.  Provisional responses provide information on the
   progress of the request processing, but are not sent reliably in <a href="./rfc3261.html">RFC</a>
   <a href="./rfc3261.html">3261</a>.

   It was later observed that reliability was important in several
   cases, including interoperability scenarios with the PSTN.
   Therefore, an optional capability was needed to support reliable
   transmission of provisional responses.  That capability is provided
   in this specification.

   The reliability mechanism works by mirroring the current reliability
   mechanisms for 2xx final responses to INVITE.  Those requests are
   transmitted periodically by the Transaction User (TU) until a
   separate transaction, ACK, is received that indicates reception of
   the 2xx by the UAC.  The reliability for the 2xx responses to INVITE
   and ACK messages are end-to-end.  In order to achieve reliability for
   provisional responses, we do nearly the same thing.  Reliable
   provisional responses are retransmitted by the TU with an exponential
   backoff.  Those retransmissions cease when a PRACK message is
   received.  The PRACK request plays the same role as ACK, but for
   provisional responses.  There is an important difference, however.
   PRACK is a normal SIP message, like BYE.  As such, its own
   reliability is ensured hop-by-hop through each stateful proxy.  Also
   like BYE, but unlike ACK, PRACK has its own response.  If this were
   not the case, the PRACK message could not traverse proxy servers
   compliant to <a href="./rfc2543.html">RFC 2543</a> [<a href="#ref-4" title='"SIP: Session Initiation Protocol"'>4</a>].

   Each provisional response is given a sequence number, carried in the
   RSeq header field in the response.  The PRACK messages contain an
   RAck header field, which indicates the sequence number of the
   provisional response that is being acknowledged.  The acknowledgments
   are not cumulative, and the specifications recommend a single
   outstanding provisional response at a time, for purposes of
   congestion control.

   "<em>SHALL</em>", "<em>SHALL NOT</em>", "<em>SHOULD</em>", "<em>SHOULD NOT</em>", "<em>RECOMMENDED</em>", "<em>MAY</em>",
   and "<em>OPTIONAL</em>" are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119.html">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title='"Key Words for Use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"'>2</a>] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations.

<span class="h2"><html><body><a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Shortcut/3%20UAS%20Behavior"></a></body></html><a class="selflink" href="#section-3" id="section-3">3</a> UAS Behavior</span>

   A UAS <em>MAY</em> send any non-100 provisional response to INVITE reliably,
   so long as the initial INVITE request (the request whose provisional
   response is being sent reliably) contained a Supported header field
   with the option tag 100rel.  While this specification does not allow
   reliable provisional responses for any method but INVITE, extensions
   that define new methods that can establish dialogs may make use of
   the mechanism.

   The UAS <em>MUST</em> send any non-100 provisional response reliably if the
   initial request contained a Require header field with the option tag
   100rel.  If the UAS is unwilling to do so, it <em>MUST</em> reject the initial
   request with a 420 (Bad Extension) and include an Unsupported header
   field containing the option tag 100rel.

   A UAS <em>MUST NOT</em> attempt to send a 100 (Trying) response reliably.
   Only provisional responses numbered 101 to 199 may be sent reliably.
   If the request did not include either a Supported or Require header
   field indicating this feature, the UAS <em>MUST NOT</em> send the provisional
   response reliably.

      100 (Trying) responses are hop-by-hop only.  For this reason, the
      reliability mechanisms described here, which are end-to-end,
      cannot be used.

   An element that can act as a proxy can also send reliable provisional
   responses.  In this case, it acts as a UAS for purposes of that
   transaction.  However, it <em>MUST NOT</em> attempt to do so for any request
   that contains a tag in the To field.  That is, a proxy cannot
   generate reliable provisional responses to requests sent within the
   context of a dialog.  Of course, unlike a UAS, when the proxy element
   receives a PRACK that does not match any outstanding reliable
   provisional response, the PRACK <em>MUST</em> be proxied.

   There are several reasons why a UAS might want to send a reliable
   provisional response.  One reason is if the INVITE transaction will
   take some time to generate a final response.  As discussed in <a href="./rfc3261.html#section-13.3.1.1">Section</a>
   <a href="./rfc3261.html#section-13.3.1.1">13.3.1.1 of RFC 3261</a>, the UAS will need to send periodic provisional
   responses to request an "extension" of the transaction at proxies.
   The requirement is that a proxy receive them every three minutes, but



<span class="grey">Rosenberg &amp; Schulzrinne     Standards Track                     [Page 3]</span></pre>
<hr class="noprint"/><!--NewPage--><pre class="newpage"><span id="page-4"></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc3262.html">RFC 3262</a>      Reliability of Provisional Responses in SIP      June 2002</span>


   the UAS needs to send them more frequently (once a minute is
   recommended) because of the possibility of packet loss.  As a more
   efficient alternative, the UAS can send the response reliably, in
   which case the UAS <em>SHOULD</em> send provisional responses once every two
   and a half minutes.  Use of reliable provisional responses for
   extending transactions is <em>RECOMMENDED</em>.

   The rest of this discussion assumes that the initial request
   contained a Supported or Require header field listing 100rel, and
   that there is a provisional response to be sent reliably.

   The provisional response to be sent reliably is constructed by the
   UAS core according to the procedures of <a href="./rfc3261.html#section-8.2.6">Section 8.2.6 of RFC 3261</a>.
   In addition, it <em>MUST</em> contain a Require header field containing the
   option tag 100rel, and <em>MUST</em> include an RSeq header field.  The value
   of the header field for the first reliable provisional response in a
   transaction <em>MUST</em> be between 1 and 2**31 - 1.  It is <em>RECOMMENDED</em> that
   it be chosen uniformly in this range.  The RSeq numbering space is
   within a single transaction.  This means that provisional responses
   for different requests <em>MAY</em> use the same values for the RSeq number.

   The reliable provisional response <em>MAY</em> contain a body.  The usage of
   session descriptions is described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a>.

   The reliable provisional response is passed to the transaction layer
   periodically with an interval that starts at T1 seconds and doubles
   for each retransmission (T1 is defined in <a href="./rfc3261.html#section-17">Section 17 of RFC 3261</a>).
   Once passed to the server transaction, it is added to an internal
   list of unacknowledged reliable provisional responses.  The
   transaction layer will forward each retransmission passed from the
   UAS core.

      This differs from retransmissions of 2xx responses, whose
      intervals cap at T2 seconds.  This is because retransmissions of
      ACK are triggered on receipt of a 2xx, but retransmissions of
      PRACK take place independently of reception of 1xx.

   Retransmissions of the reliable provisional response cease when a
   matching PRACK is received by the UA core.  PRACK is like any other
   request within a dialog, and the UAS core processes it according to
   the procedures of Sections <a href="#section-8.2">8.2</a> and <a href="#section-12.2.2">12.2.2</a> of <a href="./rfc3261.html">RFC 3261</a>.  A matching
   PRACK is defined as one within the same dialog as the response, and
   whose method, CSeq-num, and response-num in the RAck header field
   match, respectively, the method from the CSeq, the sequence number
   from the CSeq, and the sequence number from the RSeq of the reliable
   provisional response.

   If a PRACK request is received by the UA core that does not match any
   unacknowledged reliable provisional response, the UAS <em>MUST</em> respond to
   the PRACK with a 481 response.  If the PRACK does match an
   unacknowledged reliable provisional response, it <em>MUST</em> be responded to
   with a 2xx response.  The UAS can be certain at this point that the
   provisional response has been received in order.  It <em>SHOULD</em> cease
   retransmissions of the reliable provisional response, and <em>MUST</em> remove
   it from the list of unacknowledged provisional responses.

   If a reliable provisional response is retransmitted for 64*T1 seconds
   without reception of a corresponding PRACK, the UAS <em>SHOULD</em> reject the
   original request with a 5xx response.

   If the PRACK contained a session description, it is processed as
   described in <a href="#section-5">Section 5</a> of this document.  If the PRACK instead
   contained any other type of body, the body is treated in the same way
   that body in an ACK would be treated.

   After the first reliable provisional response for a request has been
   acknowledged, the UAS <em>MAY</em> send additional reliable provisional
   responses.  The UAS <em>MUST NOT</em> send a second reliable provisional
   response until the first is acknowledged.  After the first, it is
   <em>RECOMMENDED</em> that the UAS not send an additional reliable provisional
   response until the previous is acknowledged.  The first reliable
   provisional response receives special treatment because it conveys
   the initial sequence number.  If additional reliable provisional
   responses were sent before the first was acknowledged, the UAS could
   not be certain these were received in order.

   The value of the RSeq in each subsequent reliable provisional
   response for the same request <em>MUST</em> be greater by exactly one.  RSeq
   numbers <em>MUST NOT</em> wrap around.  Because the initial one is chosen to
   be less than 2**31 - 1, but the maximum is 2**32 - 1, there can be up
   to 2**31 reliable provisional responses per request, which is more
   than sufficient.

   The UAS <em>MAY</em> send a final response to the initial request before
   having received PRACKs for all unacknowledged reliable provisional
   responses, unless the final response is 2xx and any of the
   unacknowledged reliable provisional responses contained a session
   description.  In that case, it <em>MUST NOT</em> send a final response until
   those provisional responses are acknowledged.  If the UAS does send a
   final response when reliable responses are still unacknowledged, it
   <em>SHOULD NOT</em> continue to retransmit the unacknowledged reliable
   provisional responses, but it <em>MUST</em> be prepared to process PRACK
   requests for those outstanding responses.  A UAS <em>MUST NOT</em> send new
   reliable provisional responses (as opposed to retransmissions of
   unacknowledged ones) after sending a final response to a request.

   When the UAC creates a new request, it can insist on reliable
   delivery of provisional responses for that request.  To do that, it
   inserts a Require header field with the option tag 100rel into the
   request.  A Require header with the value 100rel <em>MUST NOT</em> be present
   in any requests excepting INVITE, although extensions to SIP may
   allow its usage with other request methods.

   If the UAC does not wish to insist on usage of reliable provisional
   responses, but merely indicate that it supports them if the UAS needs
   to send one, a Supported header <em>MUST</em> be included in the request with
   the option tag 100rel.  The UAC <em>SHOULD</em> include this in all INVITE
   requests.

   If a provisional response is received for an initial request, and
   that response contains a Require header field containing the option
   tag 100rel, the response is to be sent reliably.  If the response is
   a 100 (Trying) (as opposed to 101 to 199), this option tag <em>MUST</em> be
   ignored, and the procedures below <em>MUST NOT</em> be used.

   The provisional response <em>MUST</em> establish a dialog if one is not yet
   created.

   Assuming the response is to be transmitted reliably, the UAC <em>MUST</em>
   create a new request with method PRACK.  This request is sent within
   the dialog associated with the provisional response (indeed, the
   provisional response may have created the dialog).  PRACK requests
   <em>MAY</em> contain bodies, which are interpreted according to their type and
   disposition.

   Note that the PRACK is like any other non-INVITE request within a
   dialog.  In particular, a UAC <em>SHOULD NOT</em> retransmit the PRACK request
   when it receives a retransmission of the provisional response being
   acknowledged, although doing so does not create a protocol error.

   Once a reliable provisional response is received, retransmissions of
   that response <em>MUST</em> be discarded.  A response is a retransmission when
   its dialog ID, CSeq, and RSeq match the original response.  The UAC
   <em>MUST</em> maintain a sequence number that indicates the most recently
   received in-order reliable provisional response for the initial
   request.  This sequence number <em>MUST</em> be maintained until a final
   response is received for the initial request.  Its value <em>MUST</em> be
   initialized to the RSeq header field in the first reliable
   provisional response received for the initial request.

   Handling of subsequent reliable provisional responses for the same
   initial request follows the same rules as above, with the following
   difference: reliable provisional responses are guaranteed to be in
   order.  As a result, if the UAC receives another reliable provisional
   response to the same request, and its RSeq value is not one higher
   than the value of the sequence number, that response <em>MUST NOT</em> be
   acknowledged with a PRACK, and <em>MUST NOT</em> be processed further by the
   UAC.  An implementation <em>MAY</em> discard the response, or <em>MAY</em> cache the
   response in the hopes of receiving the missing responses.

   The UAC <em>MAY</em> acknowledge reliable provisional responses received after
   the final response or <em>MAY</em> discard them.

   offers and answers [<a href="#ref-3" title='"An Offer/Answer Model with SDP"'>3</a>] can appear.  Based on those guidelines, this
   extension provides additional opportunities for offer/answer
   exchanges.

   If the INVITE contained an offer, the UAS <em>MAY</em> generate an answer in a
   reliable provisional response (assuming these are supported by the
   UAC).  That results in the establishment of the session before

   completion of the call.  Similarly, if a reliable provisional
   response is the first reliable message sent back to the UAC, and the
   INVITE did not contain an offer, one <em>MUST</em> appear in that reliable
   provisional response.

   If the UAC receives a reliable provisional response with an offer
   (this would occur if the UAC sent an INVITE without an offer, in
   which case the first reliable provisional response will contain the
   offer), it <em>MUST</em> generate an answer in the PRACK.  If the UAC receives
   a reliable provisional response with an answer, it <em>MAY</em> generate an
   additional offer in the PRACK.  If the UAS receives a PRACK with an
   offer, it <em>MUST</em> place the answer in the 2xx to the PRACK.

   Once an answer has been sent or received, the UA <em>SHOULD</em> establish the
   session based on the parameters of the offer and answer, even if the
   original INVITE itself has not been responded to.

   If the UAS had placed a session description in any reliable
   provisional response that is unacknowledged when the INVITE is
   accepted, the UAS <em>MUST</em> delay sending the 2xx until the provisional
   response is acknowledged.  Otherwise, the reliability of the 1xx
   cannot be guaranteed, and reliability is needed for proper operation
   of the offer/answer exchange.

   All user agents that support this extension <em>MUST</em> support all
   offer/answer exchanges that are possible based on the rules in
   <a href="./rfc3261.html#section-13.2">Section 13.2 of RFC 3261</a>, based on the existence of INVITE and PRACK
   as requests, and 2xx and reliable 1xx as non-failure reliable
   responses.
